<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression
hypothesis: >-
  A target LLM's own next-token prediction surprisal (negative log-likelihood) on its input prompt provides a more accurate
  importance signal for hard token pruning than any proxy model's perplexity, because it directly measures what the target
  model itself finds predictable versus surprising — eliminating the proxy-model mismatch that plagues current methods like
  LLMLingua and SelectiveContext.
motivation: >-
  All existing hard prompt compression methods (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua, LLMLingua-2, SelectiveContext, ProCut) rely on a
  smaller proxy model (GPT-2, BERT, or fine-tuned small LM) to score token importance via perplexity or self-information.
  This creates a fundamental proxy-model mismatch: the proxy's predictions don't match the target LLM's, leading to suboptimal
  pruning. Meanwhile, soft prompt methods (SelfCP, ICAE, GIST) use the target LLM but produce dense vectors requiring learnable
  connectors and training. No method uses the target LLM's own next-token logits to directly compute per-token surprisal for
  hard token pruning. Predictive coding theory from neuroscience suggests that only 'surprising' inputs (high prediction error)
  carry new information for a predictive system; tokens the model predicts well are self-redundant. This hypothesis bridges
  that gap.
assumptions:
- >-
  Target LLM exposes next-token logits/probabilities for prompt tokens (available for local models via HuggingFace, some APIs)
- >-
  Surprisal computed as -log P(token | preceding context) under the target LLM's own distribution correlates with token importance
  for that model's generation
- >-
  Low-surprisal tokens are genuinely self-redundant for the target model (not just predictable in general)
- >-
  Hard token pruning based on self-surprisal preserves task performance better than proxy-model perplexity at equal compression
  ratios
- >-
  Single forward pass to compute all token surprisals is computationally feasible within budget
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Implement Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (SSHPC): for each prompt token, compute -log P(token | preceding context)
  using target LLM's forward pass; prune lowest-surprisal tokens to target compression ratio. 2. Compare against LLMLingua,
  LLMLingua-2, SelectiveContext, and random pruning baselines on LongBench, NaturalQuestions, GSM8K, and HotpotQA. 3. Test
  across multiple target LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Qwen2-7B, Mistral-7B) and compression ratios (2x, 4x, 8x, 10x). 4. Measure task
  accuracy, hallucination rate, and inference latency. 5. Ablate: compare self-surprisal vs. proxy-model perplexity on same
  target LLM to isolate proxy-mismatch effect.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) SSHPC matches or exceeds LLMLingua-2 task accuracy at equal/higher compression ratios on >=3/4 benchmarks;
  (b) SSHPC outperforms proxy-model baselines by >=2% absolute accuracy at high compression (8x+); (c) Ablation shows proxy-model
  perplexity on same target LLM degrades vs self-surprisal, confirming proxy-mismatch as key factor. DISCONFIRMED if: SSHPC
  consistently underperforms proxy baselines, or self-surprisal correlates poorly with actual token importance measured via
  leave-one-out ablation.

- >-
  Fundamental Limits of Prompt Compression (Nagle et al., 2024): Rate-distortion framework — theoretical baseline, no self-surprisal
  method
inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer from neuroscience (predictive coding / Free Energy Principle) and information theory (rate-distortion).
  Predictive coding posits the brain minimizes surprisal by predicting next inputs; only prediction errors (high surprisal)
  propagate up the hierarchy — predictable inputs are 'explained away' as redundant. Applied to LLMs: tokens the target model
  predicts well from context carry little new information for its own generation. This is a Level 3 methodological transfer
  — importing the concrete mechanism of surprisal-based filtering from predictive coding directly as a hard prompt compression
  algorithm.
terms:
- term: Surprisal (Self-Information)
  definition: >-
    Negative log-likelihood of a token under the model's next-token prediction distribution: -log P(token | preceding context).
    Measures how 'surprised' the model is by that token given its context.
- term: Proxy-Model Mismatch
  definition: >-
    The gap between a smaller proxy model's (e.g., GPT-2) token importance scores and the target LLM's (e.g., Llama-3-8B)
    actual sensitivity to those tokens, causing suboptimal pruning decisions.
- term: Hard Prompt Compression
  definition: >-
    Removing discrete tokens from the original natural language prompt while keeping remaining tokens unchanged — as opposed
    to soft prompt compression which produces continuous dense vectors.
- term: Predictive Coding
  definition: >-
    Neuroscience theory where hierarchical neural systems minimize free energy by predicting incoming sensory inputs; only
    prediction errors (surprisal) are forwarded, making predictable inputs informationally redundant for that system.
- term: Rate-Distortion Theory
  definition: >-
    Information-theoretic framework characterizing the fundamental trade-off between compression rate (bits) and distortion
    (fidelity loss) for a given source and distortion measure.
summary: >-
  Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (SSHPC) uses the target LLM's own next-token prediction logits to compute per-token
  surprisal on the input prompt, then prunes the most predictable (lowest surprisal) tokens. This eliminates the proxy-model
  mismatch that limits LLMLingua, SelectiveContext, and LLMLingua-2, while avoiding the training overhead and soft-token complexity
  of methods like SelfCP. Grounded in predictive coding theory from neuroscience.
alternates:
- title: Query-Conditioned Self-Surprisal
  hypothesis: >-
    Computing token surprisal conditioned on the query/task (P(token | context + query)) rather than context alone yields
    better pruning for query-aware tasks like QA and RAG, because it captures what's surprising specifically for the downstream
    task.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If query-specific information is the primary driver of token importance (as LongLLMLingua's question-aware compression
    shows), conditioning surprisal on the query could outperform unconditional self-surprisal, especially for RAG and multi-document
    QA where most context is irrelevant to the query.
- title: Attention-Weighted Self-Surprisal
  hypothesis: >-
    Weighting each token's self-surprisal by its attention mass (how much subsequent tokens attend to it) produces a more
    accurate importance score than raw surprisal alone, because it captures both self-predictability and causal influence
    on generation.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If some low-surprisal tokens are causally critical (e.g., rare but pivotal keywords that subsequent tokens heavily attend
    to), pure surprisal would incorrectly prune them. Attention-weighting corrects this by incorporating the target LLM's
    own causal dependency structure.
- title: Iterative Self-Surprisal Refinement
  hypothesis: >-
    Iteratively recomputing self-surprisal after each pruning round (since context changes) yields better compression than
    single-pass scoring, because token predictability shifts as surrounding tokens are removed.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If token surprisal is highly context-dependent (as LLMLingua's iterative compression suggests), single-pass scoring based
    on the original context becomes stale. Iterative recomputation adapts to the evolving compressed context, potentially
    enabling higher compression ratios with less performance loss.

id: experiment_iter1_dir3
type: experiment
objective: >-
  Implement and run a coarse screen of all four SSHPC variants plus three proxy baselines on a 10% sample of each benchmark
  (≈500 prompts total) at 4 compression ratios (2x, 4x, 8x, 10x) on one target LLM (Llama-3-8B) to identify the surviving
  candidate.
approach: >-
  Implement unified compression pipeline in Python using transformers: (1) Base SSHPC: single forward pass, compute -log P(token|context)
  for all tokens, prune lowest-surprisal to target ratio. (2) Query-Conditioned: append question to context before surprisal
  computation. (3) Attention-Weighted: extract attention weights from last layer, compute attention mass per token (sum over
  subsequent positions), multiply surprisal * attention_mass. (4) Iterative: 3 rounds, recompute surprisal after each pruning.
  Baselines: LLMLingua (GPT-2 perplexity), SelectiveContext (GPT-2 self-information), Random pruning. Metrics: Exact Match
  (GSM8K), F1 (HotpotQA, NQ), Rouge-L (LongBench summarization). Run on single GPU with batch size 1. Selection rule: Candidate
  with highest mean accuracy at 8x compression across ≥3/4 benchmarks survives. If tie, prefer simpler method (fewer forward
  passes). Output: method_out.json with per-candidate per-benchmark per-ratio results.

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EXPERIMENT executor scope:
  Output: method_out.json with results (metrics, predictions, analysis) — the core computational work
  DOES: Implement and run methods/algorithms, compute metrics, compare approaches, produce quantitative results
  DOES NOT: Collect new datasets (depends on DATASET artifacts for input data), write formal proofs
  This is the right artifact for any code that processes data and produces results
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EXPERIMENT: Must depend on at least one DATASET. Define clear metrics and baselines before running. Consider trying multiple method variations rather than a single approach.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

# Computational linguistics — field handbook

## Overview

Scope: computational linguistics as a SCIENCE of language — what models reveal about language and
about human language processing, and how such claims are measured. NLP engineering (training,
prompting, retrieval, agents) is out of scope. The star is the SUBSTRATE below: a dated,
source-anchored map with an explicit do-not-redo list. The only IDEATION lens is open questions;
a thin execution floor follows it.

**How to use this map.** It is a STARTING POINT, not a substitute for looking. Its crowded
list is necessarily incomplete and its frontier is dated; map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,
never *open*. Before committing to any direction, run your own fresh, dated saturation search
on that specific direction and confirm it is actually unoccupied. Treat the sections below as
material to reason against — the questions especially — rather than as conclusions to accept.

## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)

- **The measurement instrument is itself under audit.** A 445-benchmark, 29-reviewer systematic review found "patterns
  related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and scoring metrics which undermine the validity of the
  resulting claims" [S2] — a capability claim is judged on its construct, not just its number.
- **Output is not competence.** "LLMs' metalinguistic judgments are inferior to quantities directly
  derived from representations" [S3]; grammaticality separates in hidden states where string
  probability does not [S12].
- **A negative result about a model is a claim about your probe:** "negative results relying on
  metalinguistic prompts cannot be taken as conclusive evidence that an LLM lacks a particular
  linguistic generalization" [S3].
- **Disagreement is data.** Human label variation "reflects the diversity of human perspectives
  rather than mere error"; collapsing it manufactures "artificial consensus" [S7].
- **Explanatory status is graded, and the grades are named.** LLMs supply "how-possibly
  explanations (HPEs)" about acquisition and competence, while "current LLMs do not yet satisfy"
  the requirements for how-actually explanations [S4].
- **Theory bounds the empirics** — expressivity results explain "why current transformer
  architectures struggle to implement exact discrete algorithms" [S24] — but they are
  assumption-relative by construction [S11].

## Frontier (recency-weighted)

**Measurement & construct validity** *(weight-capped — the loudest thread)*

- A systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks by 29 expert reviewers found validity-undermining
  patterns across measured phenomena, tasks and scoring metrics [S2] (NeurIPS 2025).
- The JUDGe 2026 workshop frames judge validity as a systems property: "Evaluation validity is not a property of
  a judge in isolation" [S25] (2026). Peer-reviewed baseline beneath it: reliability varies by
  property, judge expertise, and whether text is human- or model-generated [S21] (ACL 2025).
- Contamination has its own position paper, which sets out to "highlight the wide prevalence of
  benchmark dataset contamination and outline the properties of contamination-resistant datasets"
  [S14] (ICML 2026 Position Track).

**What LMs represent vs what they output**

- A grammaticality probe "outperforms LM probability-based grammaticality judgments" — yet
  on semantic plausibility "the probe however performs worse than string probability" [S12] (2026-05).
- ACL 2026's Best Paper found a directional semantic failure: a "pervasive Teleological Bias" where
  models "hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, even overriding explicit textual
  cancellation"; prompting interventions "partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration
  crisis" [S8] (2026).

**Cognitive modelling and the scale paradox**

- Surprisal's fit to reading times peaks near two billion training tokens, after which perplexity
  gains produce "poorer fits to human reading times" [S16] (Findings of EMNLP 2023).
- Not an artifact of latency measures — the inverse relation "still obtains" on two fMRI datasets
  across 17 LMs [S17] (EACL 2026).
- The predictor is unstable: early-layer representations beat surprisal on early-pass eye movements,
  and "the best-performing predictor varies strongly depending on the language and eye-tracking
  measure" [S23] (ACL 2026).

**The resource map and language varieties**

- Catalogue counts mislead: 59% of the surveyed languages score zero catalogued-dataset density, yet literature mining shows active dataset production for many [S5] (2026-05).
- The dominant multilingual benchmark is criticized at protocol level — many translations "fall below
  the claimed 90% quality standard", and "copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU
  scores" [S13] (EMNLP 2025).

**Annotation, disagreement, pluralism**

- The perspectivist turn has its own survey, mapping "a shift from consensus learning toward
  explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among
  annotators" [S6] (2026-01).

**Meta-science of the field**

- Submission volume outran reviewing capacity — 17,087 submissions against 1,424 area chairs,
  with the community weighing "options for limiting submissions for the first time in ACL's
  history" [S1] (2026-05) — yet measured review quality shows "no consistent decline in median
  review quality across venues and years" [S22] (2026-01). ACL 2026's special theme was model
  explainability [S10].

## Recent (~1–2 yr, compressed) · Durable core

- Durable and still load-bearing: surprisal theory as the LM-to-processing-cost bridge [S16];
  minimal-pair evaluation as the standard syntactic instrument [S12]; direct probability
  measurement as the stronger read-out of linguistic knowledge [S3]; the child-learning data
  bound — "less than 100 million words" — with curriculum learning, heavily attempted,
  "largely unsuccessful" [S18].
- The three standing stances on LLMs and linguistic theory [S4]: **insulationism** (LLMs are
  irrelevant to human language), **eliminativism** (they can replace traditional linguistic
  theories), **conciliationism** (they are useful tools for linguistic research).

## ⛔ Already crowded — go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)

The blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:

- **Creating another multilingual / low-resource benchmark.** Dense and institutionalized: the
  FLORES+ family plus its published protocol critique [S13], variety-level suites [S19], and
  and a 232-paper survey of the multilingual/edge pipeline [S20].
- **Benchmark-contamination detection.** Saturated; the prevalence of contamination and the
  properties of resistant datasets are already laid out in a peer-reviewed position paper [S14].
- **LLM-as-judge meta-evaluation and bias catalogues.** A 20-dataset / 11-model peer-reviewed study
  [S21] plus a dedicated 2026 workshop [S25] own this.
- **Minimal-pair grammaticality evaluation and its representation-level follow-up.** Models already
  "discriminate well between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences in tightly controlled minimal
  pairs", and the probe-vs-probability comparison is published [S12].
- **Human label variation / perspectivist modelling.** Mapped end-to-end by its own survey [S6] and
  already escalated into post-training [S7].
- **Computational morphology and low-resource dependency parsing.** Both have their own survey and
  a 2026 cross-architecture evaluation [S29] [S30].
- **Computational sociolinguistics / dialect NLP.** Mapped by its own survey [S27], with a
  variety-level benchmark already published [S19].
- **Sign-language processing tooling and reproducibility.** The ad-hoc-code problem and a framework
  answer to it are published [S28].
- **Language-documentation annotation tooling.** 98 tools already surveyed against documentary
  requirements [S26].
- **Coreference and discourse resolution.** A shared-task series in its fifth edition, with a 2026
  benchmark wave alongside it [S31].
- **Diachronic / lexical semantic change.** Mature enough that its canonical benchmark is itself
  under published critique, with a dedicated workshop series [S32].
- **Surprisal-vs-reading-time psychometrics.** The inverse-scaling result, its tipping point, its
  fMRI generalization, and its layerwise refinement are all published [S16] [S17] [S23].

> **Standing directive — this list is necessarily INCOMPLETE.** Map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,
> NOT *open*. Before committing to any direction this map does not explicitly flag as crowded, run a
> fresh, dated saturation search and confirm the space is actually unoccupied. (Measured in this forge's own
> A/B runs: a live-searching baseline beats a static handbook precisely on the crowded lanes a map omits.)

## Open questions the field hasn't answered

*(the whole lens — the reader answers in their own way)*

1. Prompted output underestimates linguistic knowledge [S3], and grammaticality separates in hidden
   states where string probability does not [S12]. **Is the observable this field treats as its
   measurement — model output, or string probability — even the right object for a claim about
   linguistic competence?** Instruments changed without this being settled.
2. If a review of 445 benchmarks finds validity-undermining patterns [S2] while judge validity is a
   property of a whole pipeline rather than a judge [S25], what would a capability claim here have
   to report before it should be believed?
3. LLMs supply how-possibly but not how-actually explanations of language [S4]. What evidence would
   move a computational result across that line, and does any current design even address it?
4. The best cognitive predictor is a deliberately undertrained model [S16] [S17], while the strongest
   predictor varies by layer, language, and measure [S23]. What is being modelled when psychometric
   fit and language-modelling quality pull in opposite directions?
5. Catalogue counts and literature evidence disagree about which languages are resourced [S5], and
   the dominant benchmark is protocol-flawed for exactly those languages [S13]. Is "low-resource" a
   property of languages, of documentation infrastructure, or of evaluation design?
6. Submission volume outran reviewing capacity to the point of considering caps [S1], yet measured
   review quality has not declined [S22]. If the bottleneck is not quality, what is the constraint
   actually selecting for in what gets published?

## What counts as DEEP here (taste)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Add a benchmark, a language, or a model to an existing evaluation and report the numbers. | *Computational Linguistics* prints the bar for a **squib**: "unexpectedness, as for example a demonstration that a commonly accepted idea or method is flawed", or "genuine novelty, as for example thus-far unnoticed language data that challenges current methods".

## Critical rules (execution · eval · validity)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Test linguistic knowledge by prompting the model to judge. | Designing the probe: read probabilities directly where possible; report prompting as a second, weaker measurement — never as sole evidence for absence. | wrong-result — negative results are unsound from prompts alone | L | [S3] |
| Report benchmark accuracy as a capability claim. | Writing the claim: define the construct, say how items operationalize it, and report uncertainty. | wrong-result — the score does not measure the named phenomenon | L | [S2] |
| Use FLORES+ as ground truth for low-resource MT quality. | Choosing the eval set: check quality and domain fit for your languages and add a naturalistic set — models strong on one can look weak on the other. | wrong-result — the benchmark's own quality bound caps your conclusion | L | [S13] |
| Aggregate annotations to a majority label by default. | Handling annotation: decide explicitly whether disagreement is error or signal for THIS task; preserve the distribution when it is signal. | wrong-result — artificial consensus erases the phenomenon | L | [S7] [S6] |
| Reach for a pretrained transformer parser on a low-resource language. | Choosing the architecture: below the data crossover a Biaffine LSTM beats transformers, and morphological complexity widens that disadvantage. | wasted-cost — the bigger model is the weaker one in that regime | L | [S30] |
| Call a language low-resource from catalogue counts. | Scoping resources: check literature-level dataset circulation, not just registered catalogues, before claiming a data gap. | wrong-result — the gap may be documentation, not data | L | [S5] |
| Argue cognitive plausibility from a bigger, better LM. | Making a processing claim: treat training data and model scale as deliberate variables and report layer and measure — the best predictor changes with both. | wrong-result — the inverse relation holds on latency and fMRI alike [S17]; fit peaks near 2B training tokens [S16] | L | [S16] [S17] [S23] |

## Decision guide

- **Competence vs performance:** for "does the model know X", read probabilities or probe
  representations [S3] [S12]; for "does it use X when generating", behavioral output is right —
  do not swap them.
- **Cognitive-modelling target:** latency and fMRI now agree on inverse scaling [S16] [S17]; early-
  vs late-pass measures disagree on the best predictor [S23] — name the measure before the model.
- **Aggregating annotations:** aggregate when the task has a defensible single answer; preserve the
  distribution when variation is interpretive [S6] [S7].
- **Placing yourself in the theory debate:** the field names three positions — insulationist,
  eliminativist, conciliationist [S4]; a paper implies one whether or not it says so.

## Ground rules (known-lane — terse)

- Surprisal = negative log probability of a word in context; the standard LM-to-processing-cost link [S16].
- Minimal pairs = near-identical sentences differing in acceptability; BLiMP-style suites are the
  canonical syntactic instrument [S12].
- Human label variation (HLV) = legitimate annotator disagreement, distinct from annotation error [S7].
- Construct validity = whether a measure represents the phenomenon it names; now a routine reviewer
  question in this field [S2].

## Reference documentation

- **[volatile.md](volatile.md)** — dated frontier numbers, lane-occupancy flags, and per-source
  review status. Re-check this FIRST before any novelty verdict or write-up.

## Candidate lane  ⚠️ (expert to resolve — NOT verified)

- ⚠️ **No peer-reviewed 2026 synthesis of "what computational linguistics is now" was recoverable
  this pass.** A Philosophy Compass survey of the philosophy of language models exists but was
  paywalled; the field-identity framing rests on one preprint [S4] plus venue artifacts [S9] [S10].
  Confirm before asserting a field-wide consensus in a write-up.
- ⚠️ **The ACL 2026 award slate could not be read with committee rationale** — the page lists titles
  only, so the taste row rests on the paper's own abstract [S8] plus the journal's printed criteria
  [S9], not a meta-review. Confirm/refute: an award rationale or area-chair commentary for ACL 2026.

name: aii-python
description: "Applies this repo's Python conventions to experiment and evaluation scripts: uv-only environment setup (never pip), loguru logging with stdout plus a rotating file sink, @logger.catch(reraise=True) with explicit exception types, pathlib file access, type hints, and a standard main() script skeleton. ALWAYS read before writing or editing any Python script that runs an experiment, evaluation, or data-processing job. Triggers: writing or refactoring a Python script, uv venv, uv pip install, pyproject dependencies, loguru, logging setup, try/except and error handling, pathlib, script structure, Python 3.12. NOT for: parallelism, GPU throughput or hardware sizing (use aii-parallel-computing and aii-use-hardware), scaling long autonomous jobs (use aii-long-running-tasks), splitting oversized output files (use aii-file-size-limit), calling LLMs (use aii-openrouter-llms), or notebooks meant for Colab (use aii-colab)."
---

## Environment Setup

- Python 3.12+
- **NEVER use `pip` or `.venv/bin/pip`** — they are not installed. Use `uv` for ALL package operations:
  ```bash
  uv venv .venv --python=3.12
  source .venv/bin/activate  # or: .venv/bin/python script.py
  uv pip install pandas loguru  # NOT: pip install
  ```
- Create `.toml` file with dependencies, create uv `.venv` and activate it
- NO inline dependencies (no `# /// script` headers)

## Logging

Use `loguru` for all logging. Add a file sink alongside stdout.

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove()  # Remove default handler
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")
```

Rules:
- Log every major step (data loading, processing start/end, results)
- If applicable, log every LLM API call input and output
- Truncate long outputs in logs (add truncation logic for potentially large strings)
- Use `logger.error()` in except blocks (traceback auto-captured)

## Error Handling

- Wrap major operations in try/except blocks
- Use `@logger.catch(reraise=True)` decorator on main functions — without `reraise=True`, the script exits 0 even on uncaught exceptions, hiding failures from downstream consumers
- Use explicit exception types, not bare `except:`
- Never silently swallow exceptions — always log them

```python
@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    try:
        data = load_data(path)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error("Data file not found")
        raise
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logger.error("Invalid JSON in data file")
        raise
```

## Code Structure

- Use `pathlib.Path` for file operations: `Path("data/input.json").read_text()` not `open(...).read()`
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Use keyword arguments for functions with more than 4 parameters
- No hardcoded paths — derive from script location or accept as arguments

## Script Pattern

Standard pattern for experiment/evaluation scripts:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Brief description of what this script does."""

from loguru import logger
from pathlib import Path
import json
import sys

logger.remove()
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")

@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    # Load data
    data_path = Path("full_data_out.json")
    logger.info(f"Loading data from {data_path}")
    data = json.loads(data_path.read_text())
    logger.info(f"Loaded {len(data['examples'])} examples")

    # Process
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(data["examples"]):
        try:
            result = process(example)
            results.append(result)
        except Exception:
            logger.error(f"Failed on example {i}")
            continue

    # Save output
    output = {"examples": results}
    Path("method_out.json").write_text(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
    logger.info(f"Saved {len(results)} results")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

name: aii-long-running-tasks
description: "Scales an experiment or evaluation up in stages — mini, 10, 50, 100, 200, then the largest run that fits — recording runtime at each step and extrapolating time-per-example against the remaining time budget before growing further, with background execution and hard RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_CPU caps. ALWAYS read before launching any script expected to run for many minutes or hours over a dataset. Triggers: long-running job, overnight or unattended run, time budget, how many examples fit, extrapolate runtime, start small then scale up, run in background and poll, avoid a timeout, full-dataset evaluation, resource limits. NOT for choosing the concurrency mechanism itself (aii-parallel-computing), measuring the machine's CPU, RAM or GPU (aii-use-hardware), or provisioning cloud pods (aii-runpod)."
---

## Core Principles

1. **Time budget first**: Read your time/runtime constraints before running anything. Set every Bash timeout to fit within the budget.
2. **Start small, scale up**: Run on minimal input first, fix errors, then increase scale.
3. **Extrapolate before scaling**: Use recorded runtimes to predict whether the next step fits in the budget. Don't guess — calculate.
4. **Background execution**: For anything that takes >1 min, run in background (`run_in_background=true`) and do useful work while waiting.
5. **Stop early if needed**: Quality results on less data beats a timeout or crash. It's always acceptable to stop at a smaller scale.

---

## Gradual Scaling Sequence

Run code at increasing data sizes, checking runtime at each step.

Substitute your actual file names:
- `{mini_file}` — mini JSON (3 examples) from dependency workspace
- `{full_file}` — full dataset from dependency workspace
- `{script}` — your processing script (e.g., `./method.py`, `./eval.py`)
- `{schema}` — JSON schema to validate output against

**STEP 1 — MINI DATA:** Run `{script}` on `{mini_file}`. Do NOT truncate logs. Fix all errors. Validate output against `{schema}`. Verify you are NOT using mock scripts, mock data, or mock APIs.

**STEP 2 — 10 EXAMPLES:** Modify `{script}` to load only the first 10 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Validate schema. Record the runtime.

**STEP 3 — 50 EXAMPLES:** Load first 50 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. **EXTRAPOLATE**: Using runtimes from steps 2-3, estimate time per example. Calculate how many examples fit in your remaining time budget. If 50 already used most of the budget, stop here.

**STEP 4 — 100 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 100 examples. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. Re-extrapolate with the new data point.

**STEP 5 — 200 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 200 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime.

**STEP 6 — MAXIMIZE:** Using all recorded runtimes, extrapolate time-per-example (it may not be perfectly linear — account for overhead). Calculate the maximum number of examples that fits within your remaining time budget with a 10% safety margin. Load that many (or all if they fit). Run and validate.

## Final Testing Phase

After completing the scaling sequence, redo the entire sequence **one more time** up to your final example count:

mini → 10 → 50 → 100 → 200 → max

At each scale: look for issues, fix problems, validate output, ensure it completes within time limits.

---

## Background Execution

For any step that takes >1 min, run as a **background task**:

1. Launch with Bash `run_in_background=true`
2. While it runs, use the time productively:
   - Sanity-check previous outputs
   - Verify file integrity (correct field names, non-empty values)
   - Review code for edge cases at larger scale
   - Prepare the next step
3. Check back on the background task to get results
4. If it failed, fix errors and re-run

---

## Resource Limits

Set hard RAM and CPU time limits so code fails fast instead of crashing the system. Read limits from `<hardware>` and leave headroom for the OS (e.g., if 16GB total, cap at 14GB).

Python example using stdlib `resource` module:
```python
import resource
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (14 * 1024**3, 14 * 1024**3))  # 14GB RAM
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (3600, 3600))  # 1 hour CPU time
```
Exceeding RAM raises `MemoryError`. Exceeding CPU time sends `SIGKILL`.

## Monitoring

At each step, record runtime AND check resource usage (`free -h` for RAM, `top -bn1 | head -5` for CPU). If memory usage is climbing toward the limit or CPU is pegged, stop and investigate before scaling further.

name: aii-parallel-computing
description: "Parallelises compute-heavy Python: asyncio with aiohttp and a bounded Semaphore for I/O-bound work, ProcessPoolExecutor under the spawn start method for CPU-bound work, NumPy vectorisation and batched PyTorch on GPU with an out-of-memory halving fallback. ALWAYS read before writing any script that loops over data, issues many API calls, downloads many files, or runs heavy computation — sequential loops are the default failure mode. Triggers: parallelise, make a slow script faster, concurrency, async, aiohttp, asyncio.gather, semaphore, multiprocessing, ProcessPoolExecutor, fork deadlock with loguru, worker count, batch size, CUDA out of memory, idle GPU, retries and rate limits. NOT for detecting what hardware exists or setting RAM and VRAM budgets (aii-use-hardware), staged scale-up against a time budget (aii-long-running-tasks), or provisioning cloud pods (aii-runpod)."
---

**ALWAYS parallelize. Sequential processing is unacceptable for any non-trivial workload.** A sequential script doing 1000 API calls takes hours and fails halfway. An async version finishes in minutes with proper error handling. ALWAYS ask: "Can this run in parallel?" — the answer is almost always yes.

Read aii-use-hardware skill first → get `NUM_CPUS`, `HAS_GPU`, `VRAM_GB`, `device`. Set `NUM_WORKERS` proportional to available CPU capacity — check `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)` and scale accordingly (e.g. 30% used → use ~70% of cores).

## Decision Tree (follow strictly)

- **I/O-bound** (API calls, downloads, web, file reads) → `asyncio` + `aiohttp` with `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`. NEVER do sequential HTTP requests in a loop.
- **CPU-bound, vectorizable** → GPU available: PyTorch on device / No GPU: NumPy vectorized ops. NEVER loop over array elements in Python.
- **CPU-bound, independent items** → `ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=NUM_WORKERS)`. NEVER process items one-by-one when they're independent.
- **Sequential** → only acceptable when items have data dependencies (each depends on the previous result).

## GPU Rules

- Use up to 90% of available VRAM — scale gradually (start small, increase after each successful run, keep 10% buffer)
- Move to device → compute → move back: `torch.tensor(data, device=device)` → `.cpu().numpy()`
- OOM fallback: catch `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` → `empty_cache()` → halve batch size → retry on GPU. Keep reducing until it fits. Stay on GPU.
- Batch large data: chunk it, `del batch` between iterations to free VRAM

## Parallelism Rules

- **CPU-bound**: `ProcessPoolExecutor` + `as_completed`, pre-allocate result list indexed by submission order
- **I/O-bound**: `asyncio` + `aiohttp`, `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`, single shared `ClientSession`, `asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)`
- Always add `tenacity` retries for transient failures, always set timeouts on HTTP requests
- **CRITICAL — `ProcessPoolExecutor` start method**: Default `fork` deadlocks with loguru (and any threading library). ALWAYS pass `mp_context=multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")` when constructing `ProcessPoolExecutor` in any script that uses loguru, threading, or async I/O. Example:
  ```python
  import multiprocessing as mp
  from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
  with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=N, mp_context=mp.get_context("spawn")) as pool:
      ...
  ```

---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

## Workflow: 3-Phase Dataset Discovery

### Phase 1: Search for Datasets
Find datasets with metadata (configs, splits, features, sizes)
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "sentiment analysis" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2: Preview Dataset (if promising)
Inspect metadata AND sample rows in one call
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k
```

### Phase 3: Download Dataset (if suitable)
Download after reviewing the preview
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --config main --split train
```

## Scripts

### Search HuggingFace Datasets (aii_hf_search_datasets.py)

Search and discover datasets on HuggingFace Hub.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "text classification" --limit 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel (venv activate does NOT work in parallel subshells):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --query {} --limit 3' ::: 'sentiment' 'classification' 'translation'
```

**Example output:**
```
Found 5 dataset(s) for query='text classification'

============================================================
Dataset 1: stanfordnlp/imdb
Downloads: 2,500,000 | Likes: 1,234
Description: Large Movie Review Dataset for binary sentiment classification...
Tags: text-classification, en, sentiment-analysis
```

**Result fields per dataset:**

Each entry in ``results`` carries:

- ``id`` / ``downloads`` / ``likes`` / ``tags`` / ``description`` — standard
  HF metadata
- ``has_loader_script`` (bool) — repo ships a top-level ``<repo>.py`` loader.
  ``datasets>=3`` won't run these directly; the dataset is reachable only
  via the Datasets Server's pre-converted parquet shards. Treat as a yellow
  flag.
- ``loadable`` (bool) — **prefer datasets where this is ``True``.** Means
  the dataset is reachable via *some* path: either native parquet (no
  script) or HF auto-converted the script's output to parquet. When
  ``False``, the script needs deps HF can't install (e.g. ``conllu``,
  custom audio decoders) and ``aii_hf_datasets__download_datasets`` will
  fail — pick a different candidate.

**Parameters:**

`--query` (optional)
- Search query string
- Example: `--query "sentiment analysis"`

`--limit` (optional)
- Maximum number of results (default: 5)

`--tags` (optional)
- Filter by tags (comma-separated)
- Format: `category:value`
- Examples: `language:en`, `task_categories:text-classification`

`--sort` (optional)
- Sort by field: `downloads`, `likes` (default: downloads)

**Tips:**
- Search displays full dataset metadata
- Use tags to filter: `--tags "language:en,task_categories:translation"`

### Download HuggingFace Dataset (aii_hf_download_datasets.py)

Download datasets and save to files.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --config main --split train
```

**Parallel execution (multiple datasets):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel. Use `eval {}` pattern when datasets need different flags (e.g. `--config`):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite 'eval {}' ::: '$PY $S openai/gsm8k --config main --split train' '$PY $S imdb --split train' '$PY $S squad --split train'
```

**Example output:**
```
Downloaded: openai/gsm8k

  train:
    Rows: 7,473
    Preview: temp/datasets/preview_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
    Mini: temp/datasets/mini_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
    Full: temp/datasets/full_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
```

**Parameters:**

`dataset_id` (required, positional)
- HuggingFace dataset ID
- Examples: `openai/gsm8k`, `imdb`

`--config` (optional)
- Dataset configuration/subset name
- Use preview to see available configs

`--split` (optional)
- Specific split to load (e.g., `train`, `test`)
- If not specified, loads all splits

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory (default: `temp/datasets/`)

`--revision` (optional)
- Git revision of the dataset repo; a commit SHA pins the exact bytes
- Default: the Hub's current `main`

**Output files (auto-saved):**
1. **Preview**: `preview_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 truncated rows - **READ THIS** for quick inspection
2. **Mini**: `mini_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 full rows - for development/testing
3. **Full**: `full_{dataset}_{split}.json` - All rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - use as input path for code

**Tips:**
- Only read preview file directly with Read tool
- Mini and full are input paths for processing code

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

name: aii-use-hardware
description: "Detects the CPU, RAM, GPU and VRAM actually available — cgroup v1 and v2 container quotas and CPU affinity rather than misleading host values — then sets RAM and VRAM budgets via resource.setrlimit and torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction so a script raises a catchable error instead of being OOM-killed, and picks the right torch wheel for the detected device. ALWAYS read before loading a large dataset, installing torch, or sizing batches and worker counts. Triggers: how much RAM or CPU or GPU is available, container memory limit, cgroup, OOM killed, MemoryError, os.cpu_count reports host cores, nproc, VRAM, CUDA available, CPU-only torch build, dataset too big for memory, chunking. NOT for spreading work across that hardware once measured (aii-parallel-computing), staged scale-up runs against a time budget (aii-long-running-tasks), or renting cloud machines (aii-runpod)."
---

**Step 1** — Run `bash scripts/get_hardware.sh` (relative to this skill's directory).

Read the `=== CGROUP ===` section carefully. If `Type: cgroup v1` or `cgroup v2`:
- You are in a **container with hard resource limits**. Exceeding them = OOM kill, no recovery.
- **Never** use `psutil.virtual_memory().total`, `free -h`, `/proc/meminfo`, `os.cpu_count()`, or `nproc` for resource limits — these report **host** values, not your container's allocation.
- **Always** read limits from the cgroup paths shown in the output, or use the Python helpers below.
- For **runtime memory monitoring**, read current usage from cgroup too:
  - v2: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.current`
  - v1: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.usage_in_bytes`

**Step 2** — Use Step 1 results to pick package variants **before** installing.

Defaults often target the most powerful environment — PyPI's `torch` ships with CUDA libs even on CPU-only hosts. Wrong variant = wasted disk, slow setup, possible import-time failures.

If `=== GPU ===` shows `No GPU`, install torch's CPU build (skips ~4.5GB of CUDA libs):
```bash
uv pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
Same idea for any library whose wheel selection depends on detected hardware (GPU/CPU-only builds, architecture-specific wheels).

After install, sanity-check imports right away (`python -c "import torch"`). Disk-pressure or interrupted installs leave half-built wheels (e.g. `libtorch_global_deps.so` missing) — catch these before the experiment runs.

**Step 3** — Set Python constants from the Step 1 results:
```python
import os, math, torch, psutil
from pathlib import Path

def _detect_cpus() -> int:
    """Detect actual CPU allocation (containers/pods/bare metal)."""
    try:  # cgroups v2 quota
        parts = Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max").read_text().split()
        if parts[0] != "max":
            return math.ceil(int(parts[0]) / int(parts[1]))
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # cgroups v1 quota
        q = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us").read_text())
        p = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_period_us").read_text())
        if q > 0:
            return math.ceil(q / p)
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # CPU affinity (cpuset — used by RunPod, Docker --cpuset-cpus)
        return len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))
    except (AttributeError, OSError): pass
    return os.cpu_count() or 1

def _container_ram_gb() -> float | None:
    """Read RAM limit from cgroup (containers/pods)."""
    for p in ["/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max", "/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes"]:
        try:
            v = Path(p).read_text().strip()
            if v != "max" and int(v) < 1_000_000_000_000:
                return int(v) / 1e9
        except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    return None

NUM_CPUS = _detect_cpus()
HAS_GPU = torch.cuda.is_available()
VRAM_GB = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_mem / 1e9 if HAS_GPU else 0
DEVICE = torch.device("cuda" if HAS_GPU else "cpu")
TOTAL_RAM_GB = _container_ram_gb() or psutil.virtual_memory().total / 1e9
AVAILABLE_RAM_GB = min(psutil.virtual_memory().available / 1e9, TOTAL_RAM_GB)
```

## Step 4 — Set Memory Limits

OOM kills the entire container. **Every script MUST set RAM and VRAM limits at startup.**

Decide the budget based on what the script actually needs. Estimate data size × 2-5x for in-memory overhead, then add ~50% breathing room for temporaries. You may use up to 90% of available RAM/VRAM, but **scale gradually** — start small (e.g. 30-50%), verify it works, then increase toward the limit. Never exceed 90% to keep a buffer for the OS, system processes, and the agent runtime itself. Going over crashes the container/machine with no recovery.

```python
import resource, psutil

_avail = psutil.virtual_memory().available
RAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate what this script needs (in bytes)
assert RAM_BUDGET < _avail, f"Budget {RAM_BUDGET/1e9:.1f}GB > available {_avail/1e9:.1f}GB"
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (RAM_BUDGET * 3, RAM_BUDGET * 3))  # 3x: virtual > RSS; raises MemoryError on exceed

if HAS_GPU:
    _free, _total = torch.cuda.mem_get_info(0)
    VRAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate GPU memory needs
    torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(min(VRAM_BUDGET / _total, 0.95))  # raises OutOfMemoryError on exceed
```

## Memory-Safe Data Processing

- **One at a time**: load one large object → process → `del obj; gc.collect()` → next
- **Load only what you need**: select specific tables/columns/rows, not entire databases
- **Test small first**: run on a sample before scaling to full data to estimate memory/time
- **Free intermediates in loops**: don't accumulate large results — aggregate incrementally
- **Size before loading**: check file/dataset size before loading; if it's >30% of `RAM_BUDGET`, chunk it

## Common Mistakes (from real crashes)

- **Skipping this skill entirely** — loading data with no RAM detection, no limits, no budget. Container OOM-killed, all agents lost.
- **Using `psutil.virtual_memory().total` instead of `_container_ram_gb()`** — reports host RAM (e.g. 66 GB) when container limit is 28 GB. You MUST use the cgroup-aware functions above.
- **Loading all tables from a multi-table database at once** — one agent loaded 14 RelBench tables simultaneously, spiked past container limit.
- **Setting no memory limits** — without `resource.setrlimit` (RAM) and `set_per_process_memory_fraction` (VRAM), a runaway script OOM-kills the container instead of raising a catchable error.
- **Using `os.cpu_count()` directly** — returns host CPUs (e.g. 192) instead of container limit (e.g. 4) on RunPod/Docker. Always use `_detect_cpus()` above which checks cgroup quota → CPU affinity → `os.cpu_count()` in order.

## Hardware Use

- Keep these results in mind for ALL subsequent tasks — don't assume more than detected
- GPU if available and parallelizable, multiprocessing if multiple CPUs
- Push available resources to their full potential — don't leave hardware idle

---

## Available Web Tools

Three levels of web tools:

1. **WebSearch** — broad discovery. Returns titles, URLs, snippets. Cheapest. Use first to scan the landscape.
2. **WebFetch** — read a specific page. LLM summarizes it. HTML only. May miss specific details.
3. **aii_web_tools__fetch_grep** — exact text extraction from HTML or PDF. Regex matching with context windows.
   Use for precise details, methodology, or when WebFetch missed something.
   Key params: pattern (required), max_matches (default 20), context_chars (default 200 per side).

**Workflow:** WebSearch → WebFetch for gist → aii_web_tools__fetch_grep for exact details or PDFs.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:

- Scripts (Search, Get Params, Call)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: Model Discovery and Calling

### Phase 1: Search for Models
Find models with pricing, context length, and descriptions
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_search_llms.py "claude" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2 (optional): Get Model Parameters
Check what parameters a specific model supports
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_get_llm_params.py "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5"
```

### Phase 3: Call Model
Call a model using the API name from search results
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py --model "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5" --input "What is 2+2?"
```

---

## Scripts

### Search OpenRouter models (aii_or_search_llms.py)

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_search_llms.py "claude" --limit 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: When running multiple searches, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:

`--instructions` (optional)
- System instructions/prompt

`--web-search` (optional)
- Enable web search with max results (e.g., 10)

`--params, -p` (optional)
- Extra model-specific parameters as JSON string
- Use `aii_or_get_llm_params.py` to see which params a model supports
- Example: `--params '{"top_k": 50, "seed": 42, "frequency_penalty": 0.5}'`

**Examples:**

Simple call:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" \
  --input "Write a haiku about coding" \
  --temperature 0.8
```

With system instructions:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5" \
  --input "Explain recursion" \
  --instructions "You are a helpful programming tutor. Keep explanations concise."
```

With reasoning (for o1-style models):
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "openai/o1" \
  --input "Solve this complex math problem" \
  --reasoning high
```

With web search:
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4" \
  --input "What are the latest AI news?" \
  --web-search 10 \
  --max-tokens 15000
```

With extra model-specific params:
```bash
# Step 1: Check what params the model supports
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_get_llm_params.py "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct"
# Shows: frequency_penalty, top_k, seed, min_p, etc.

# Step 2: Call with those params
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-openrouter-llms" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_or_call_llms.py \
  --model "meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct" \
  --input "Write a short poem" \
  --params '{"top_k": 50, "seed": 42, "frequency_penalty": 0.5}'
```

## Tips

- Use `aii_or_search_llms.py` first to find models, then copy `API` field for `--model`
- Use `aii_or_get_llm_params.py` to check what params a model supports before using `--params`
- For web search, increase `--max-tokens` to handle larger responses (15000+)
- **Every call bills, and every call is booked.** Its cost is written to the
  per-task ledger (`AII_COST_LEDGER`) so it reaches the dashboard's run cost
  and the budget ceiling — both of which can only count booked events. The
  figure is the provider's own `usage.cost` when reported, otherwise the
  model's catalog price times the tokens used.
- **On a free-tier run (`AII_FREE_TOOLS=1`, exported by the backend) only
  zero-priced models are callable.** Anything that bills is refused before the
  request goes out, rather than after the provider has already charged. Pick a
  `:free` model there — `aii_or_search_llms.py` shows the price of each.

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
