<hypothesis>
kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression
hypothesis: >-
  A target LLM's own next-token prediction surprisal (negative log-likelihood) on its input prompt provides a more accurate
  importance signal for hard token pruning than any proxy model's perplexity, because it directly measures what the target
  model itself finds predictable versus surprising — eliminating the proxy-model mismatch that plagues current methods like
  LLMLingua and SelectiveContext.
motivation: >-
  All existing hard prompt compression methods (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua, LLMLingua-2, SelectiveContext, ProCut) rely on a
  smaller proxy model (GPT-2, BERT, or fine-tuned small LM) to score token importance via perplexity or self-information.
  This creates a fundamental proxy-model mismatch: the proxy's predictions don't match the target LLM's, leading to suboptimal
  pruning. Meanwhile, soft prompt methods (SelfCP, ICAE, GIST) use the target LLM but produce dense vectors requiring learnable
  connectors and training. No method uses the target LLM's own next-token logits to directly compute per-token surprisal for
  hard token pruning. Predictive coding theory from neuroscience suggests that only 'surprising' inputs (high prediction error)
  carry new information for a predictive system; tokens the model predicts well are self-redundant. This hypothesis bridges
  that gap.
assumptions:
- >-
  Target LLM exposes next-token logits/probabilities for prompt tokens (available for local models via HuggingFace, some APIs)
- >-
  Surprisal computed as -log P(token | preceding context) under the target LLM's own distribution correlates with token importance
  for that model's generation
- >-
  Low-surprisal tokens are genuinely self-redundant for the target model (not just predictable in general)
- >-
  Hard token pruning based on self-surprisal preserves task performance better than proxy-model perplexity at equal compression
  ratios
- >-
  Single forward pass to compute all token surprisals is computationally feasible within budget
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Implement Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (SSHPC): for each prompt token, compute -log P(token | preceding context)
  using target LLM's forward pass; prune lowest-surprisal tokens to target compression ratio. 2. Compare against LLMLingua,
  LLMLingua-2, SelectiveContext, and random pruning baselines on LongBench, NaturalQuestions, GSM8K, and HotpotQA. 3. Test
  across multiple target LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Qwen2-7B, Mistral-7B) and compression ratios (2x, 4x, 8x, 10x). 4. Measure task
  accuracy, hallucination rate, and inference latency. 5. Ablate: compare self-surprisal vs. proxy-model perplexity on same
  target LLM to isolate proxy-mismatch effect.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) SSHPC matches or exceeds LLMLingua-2 task accuracy at equal/higher compression ratios on >=3/4 benchmarks;
  (b) SSHPC outperforms proxy-model baselines by >=2% absolute accuracy at high compression (8x+); (c) Ablation shows proxy-model
  perplexity on same target LLM degrades vs self-surprisal, confirming proxy-mismatch as key factor. DISCONFIRMED if: SSHPC
  consistently underperforms proxy baselines, or self-surprisal correlates poorly with actual token importance measured via
  leave-one-out ablation.

- >-
  Fundamental Limits of Prompt Compression (Nagle et al., 2024): Rate-distortion framework — theoretical baseline, no self-surprisal
  method
inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer from neuroscience (predictive coding / Free Energy Principle) and information theory (rate-distortion).
  Predictive coding posits the brain minimizes surprisal by predicting next inputs; only prediction errors (high surprisal)
  propagate up the hierarchy — predictable inputs are 'explained away' as redundant. Applied to LLMs: tokens the target model
  predicts well from context carry little new information for its own generation. This is a Level 3 methodological transfer
  — importing the concrete mechanism of surprisal-based filtering from predictive coding directly as a hard prompt compression
  algorithm.
terms:
- term: Surprisal (Self-Information)
  definition: >-
    Negative log-likelihood of a token under the model's next-token prediction distribution: -log P(token | preceding context).
    Measures how 'surprised' the model is by that token given its context.
- term: Proxy-Model Mismatch
  definition: >-
    The gap between a smaller proxy model's (e.g., GPT-2) token importance scores and the target LLM's (e.g., Llama-3-8B)
    actual sensitivity to those tokens, causing suboptimal pruning decisions.
- term: Hard Prompt Compression
  definition: >-
    Removing discrete tokens from the original natural language prompt while keeping remaining tokens unchanged — as opposed
    to soft prompt compression which produces continuous dense vectors.
- term: Predictive Coding
  definition: >-
    Neuroscience theory where hierarchical neural systems minimize free energy by predicting incoming sensory inputs; only
    prediction errors (surprisal) are forwarded, making predictable inputs informationally redundant for that system.
- term: Rate-Distortion Theory
  definition: >-
    Information-theoretic framework characterizing the fundamental trade-off between compression rate (bits) and distortion
    (fidelity loss) for a given source and distortion measure.
summary: >-
  Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (SSHPC) uses the target LLM's own next-token prediction logits to compute per-token
  surprisal on the input prompt, then prunes the most predictable (lowest surprisal) tokens. This eliminates the proxy-model
  mismatch that limits LLMLingua, SelectiveContext, and LLMLingua-2, while avoiding the training overhead and soft-token complexity
  of methods like SelfCP. Grounded in predictive coding theory from neuroscience.
alternates:
- title: Query-Conditioned Self-Surprisal
  hypothesis: >-
    Computing token surprisal conditioned on the query/task (P(token | context + query)) rather than context alone yields
    better pruning for query-aware tasks like QA and RAG, because it captures what's surprising specifically for the downstream
    task.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If query-specific information is the primary driver of token importance (as LongLLMLingua's question-aware compression
    shows), conditioning surprisal on the query could outperform unconditional self-surprisal, especially for RAG and multi-document
    QA where most context is irrelevant to the query.
- title: Attention-Weighted Self-Surprisal
  hypothesis: >-
    Weighting each token's self-surprisal by its attention mass (how much subsequent tokens attend to it) produces a more
    accurate importance score than raw surprisal alone, because it captures both self-predictability and causal influence
    on generation.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If some low-surprisal tokens are causally critical (e.g., rare but pivotal keywords that subsequent tokens heavily attend
    to), pure surprisal would incorrectly prune them. Attention-weighting corrects this by incorporating the target LLM's
    own causal dependency structure.
- title: Iterative Self-Surprisal Refinement
  hypothesis: >-
    Iteratively recomputing self-surprisal after each pruning round (since context changes) yields better compression than
    single-pass scoring, because token predictability shifts as surrounding tokens are removed.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If token surprisal is highly context-dependent (as LLMLingua's iterative compression suggests), single-pass scoring based
    on the original context becomes stale. Iterative recomputation adapts to the evolving compressed context, potentially
    enabling higher compression ratios with less performance loss.

<artifact_direction>
Make this direction concrete and actionable. Keep the same type and respect dependencies.

id: dataset_iter1_dir2
type: dataset
objective: >-
  Download and standardize four benchmark datasets (LongBench, GSM8K, HotpotQA, NaturalQuestions) into a common format with
  train/validation/test splits, prompt templates for each task type (QA, reasoning, multi-hop), and metadata for compression
  evaluation.
approach: >-
  Use HuggingFace datasets library to load: (1) LongBench (21 tasks, 4750 samples) from THUDM/LongBench - select HotpotQA,
  2WikiMultihopQA, MuSiQue, MultiFieldQA-en, GSM8K, NarrativeQA, Qasper for diverse task types; (2) GSM8K (7473 train, 1319
  test) from gsm8k main config; (3) HotpotQA (90k train, 7.4k val) from hotpotqa/hotpot_qa distractor subset; (4) NaturalQuestions
  (10.6k train, 7.8k val) from google-research-datasets/natural_questions. Create standardized JSONL files with fields: {prompt,
  context, question, answer, task_type, dataset, split}. Build few-shot prompts for ICL tasks. Reserve 20% of each test set
  as HELD-OUT for iteration 2 confirmation. Output: data_out.json with full/mini/preview variants.
depends_on: []
</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

## Contents

- Workflow (3-phase dataset discovery)
- Scripts (Search, Preview, Download)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: 3-Phase Dataset Discovery

### Phase 1: Search for Datasets
Find datasets with metadata (configs, splits, features, sizes)
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "sentiment analysis" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2: Preview Dataset (if promising)
Inspect metadata AND sample rows in one call
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k
```

### Phase 3: Download Dataset (if suitable)
Download after reviewing the preview
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --config main --split train
```

---

## Scripts

### Search HuggingFace Datasets (aii_hf_search_datasets.py)

Search and discover datasets on HuggingFace Hub.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "text classification" --limit 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel (venv activate does NOT work in parallel subshells):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --query {} --limit 3' ::: 'sentiment' 'classification' 'translation'
```

**Example output:**
```
Found 5 dataset(s) for query='text classification'

============================================================
Dataset 1: stanfordnlp/imdb
Downloads: 2,500,000 | Likes: 1,234
Description: Large Movie Review Dataset for binary sentiment classification...
Tags: text-classification, en, sentiment-analysis
```

**Result fields per dataset:**

Each entry in ``results`` carries:

- ``id`` / ``downloads`` / ``likes`` / ``tags`` / ``description`` — standard
  HF metadata
- ``has_loader_script`` (bool) — repo ships a top-level ``<repo>.py`` loader.
  ``datasets>=3`` won't run these directly; the dataset is reachable only
  via the Datasets Server's pre-converted parquet shards. Treat as a yellow
  flag.
- ``loadable`` (bool) — **prefer datasets where this is ``True``.** Means
  the dataset is reachable via *some* path: either native parquet (no
  script) or HF auto-converted the script's output to parquet. When
  ``False``, the script needs deps HF can't install (e.g. ``conllu``,
  custom audio decoders) and ``aii_hf_datasets__download_datasets`` will
  fail — pick a different candidate.

**Parameters:**

`--query` (optional)
- Search query string
- Example: `--query "sentiment analysis"`

`--limit` (optional)
- Maximum number of results (default: 5)

`--tags` (optional)
- Filter by tags (comma-separated)
- Format: `category:value`
- Examples: `language:en`, `task_categories:text-classification`

`--sort` (optional)
- Sort by field: `downloads`, `likes` (default: downloads)

**Tips:**
- Search displays full dataset metadata
- Use tags to filter: `--tags "language:en,task_categories:translation"`

### Preview HuggingFace Dataset (aii_hf_preview_datasets.py)

Inspect a specific dataset - shows metadata AND sample rows.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --num-rows 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple datasets):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \

### Download HuggingFace Dataset (aii_hf_download_datasets.py)

Download datasets and save to files.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --config main --split train
```

**Parallel execution (multiple datasets):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel. Use `eval {}` pattern when datasets need different flags (e.g. `--config`):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \

parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite 'eval {}' ::: '$PY $S openai/gsm8k --config main --split train' '$PY $S imdb --split train' '$PY $S squad --split train'
```

**Example output:**
```

**Parameters:**

`dataset_id` (required, positional)
- HuggingFace dataset ID
- Examples: `openai/gsm8k`, `imdb`

`--config` (optional)
- Dataset configuration/subset name
- Use preview to see available configs

`--split` (optional)
- Specific split to load (e.g., `train`, `test`)
- If not specified, loads all splits

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory (default: `temp/datasets/`)

`--revision` (optional)
- Git revision of the dataset repo; a commit SHA pins the exact bytes
- Default: the Hub's current `main`

**Output files (auto-saved):**
1. **Preview**: `preview_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 truncated rows - **READ THIS** for quick inspection
2. **Mini**: `mini_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 full rows - for development/testing
3. **Full**: `full_{dataset}_{split}.json` - All rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - use as input path for code

**Tips:**
- Only read preview file directly with Read tool
- Mini and full are input paths for processing code

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"

## Contents

- Workflow (2-phase table discovery process)
- Scripts (Search, Download with full parameters)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: 2-Phase Table Discovery

### Phase 1: Search for Tables
Find tables with metadata (title, description, variables)
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py "renewable energy" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2: Download Table (if suitable)
Download the table after reviewing the search results
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py "grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"
```

---

## Scripts

### Search OWID tables (aii_owid_search_datasets.py)

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py "climate change" --limit 3
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: When running multiple searches, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_search_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {} --limit 3' ::: 'renewable energy' 'climate change' 'covid mortality'
```

**Example output:**
```
Found 3 OWID tables for 'climate change':

[1] Climate Change Impacts
    Path: grapher/climate/2023-10-15/climate_impacts
    Description: Global temperature anomalies and sea level rise...
    Variables (42 total):
      - Global temperature anomaly (°C): Annual global mean temperature anomaly
      - Sea level rise (mm): Global mean sea level change
      - Atmospheric CO2 concentration (ppm): Monthly CO2 concentration at Mauna Loa
      - Arctic sea ice extent (million km²): Monthly Arctic sea ice extent
      ...
```

**Parameters:**

`query` (required, positional)
- Search query string
- Examples: `"covid"`, `"energy mix"`, `"climate change"`

`--limit` (optional)
- Number of search results to return (default: 3)
- Higher values = more results to choose from

**Tips:**
- Search queries the OWID catalog index via ``owid.catalog.search`` (network required;
  the catalog is cached after the first call, which the worker warms at init)
- Returns metadata only - no data is downloaded
- Use the `path` field from results to download specific tables
- Ranking and matching are the catalog's own (fuzzy by default) across table titles,
  descriptions and paths
- Search returns tables from all channels (garden=highest quality, meadow=raw, backport=legacy, open_numbers=Gapminder)

---

### Download OWID table (aii_owid_download_datasets.py)

Download a table by path (from search results) and save to files.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py "grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"
```

**Parallel execution (multiple tables):**

IMPORTANT: When downloading multiple tables, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-owid-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_owid_download_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {}' ::: 'grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix' 'grapher/demography/2023-10-10/population' 'grapher/health/2023-08-01/life_expectancy'
```

**Example output:**
```
Downloaded OWID table: grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix

Dimensions: 15,420 rows x 12 columns
Columns: country, year, coal, oil, gas, nuclear, hydro, solar, wind, biofuels...

Files saved:
  Mini (READ THIS for development/testing): /path/to/mini_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json
  Preview (DO NOT READ - for logging only): /path/to/preview_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json
  Full (DO NOT READ - for scripts only):    /path/to/full_grapher_energy_2023-12-12_energy_mix.json

Sample data (first 3 rows):
  Row 1:
    country: Afghanistan
    year: 2000
    coal: 0.5
    ...
```

**Parameters:**

`path` (required, positional)
- Table path from search results
- Examples: `"grapher/energy/2023-12-12/energy_mix"`, `"garden/demography/2023-10-10/population"`

**Output files (auto-saved to `temp/tables/`):**
1. **Mini**: `mini_{path}.json` - 3 full rows - **READ THIS** for development/testing
2. **Preview**: `preview_{path}.json` - 3 truncated rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - for code you write to read
3. **Full**: `full_{path}.json` - All rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - for code you write to read

**Tips:**
- **Critical**: Only read the mini file directly with Read tool. Preview and full are input paths for code you write
- Use the `path` from search results to download specific tables
- Downloads directly from OWID catalog (network required)
- Files always saved to `temp/tables/` (path included in response)

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

description: "Runs web search, page fetch as markdown, and regex grep over full HTML or PDF text via this skill's own scripts (aii_fast_web_search.py, aii_fast_web_fetch.py) — a free-first keyless search stack with Serper fallback that works even where built-in WebSearch and WebFetch are absent. Use when a query, page, or paper must be searched, read, or mined for an exact quote, number, table value, or methodology sentence, and whenever a lossy summary would lose the detail. Triggers: web search, scholarly search, OpenAlex, Crossref, Serper, fetch a URL as markdown, read a PDF, arXiv, regex grep a page, exact quote, table value, citation check. NOT for: planning a broad multi-source literature review or mass verification campaign — use aii-web-research-tools; NOT for a PDF file already on disk — extraction, form filling, merging and PDF creation are anthropic-pdf; NOT for driving a browser or testing a UI."
---

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.

### [6] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-09-19 19:03:45 UTC

```
I need detailed information about these HuggingFace datasets for a research plan. Please search the web and fetch pages to gather these details:

1. **THUDM/LongBench** (HuggingFace): What configurations/tasks are available? How many total samples? What splits exist? What are the task types included (HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, MuSiQue, MultiFieldQA-en, GSM8K, NarrativeQA, Qasper, etc.)? What's the data format (prompt, context, question, answer)?

2. **openai/gsm8k**: Confirm split sizes (train/test), config options (main/socratic), and what fields the dataset contains (question, answer, etc.).

3. **hotpotqa/hotpot_qa**: Confirm split sizes for the distractor subset, what configs are available (distractor/plain), and what fields it contains.

4. **google-research-datasets/natural_questions**: Confirm split sizes, what fields it contains (question, answer, context, etc.).

For each dataset, search the web and also fetch the HuggingFace dataset card page. Report back the exact dataset IDs, configurations, split sizes, column names, and sample data structure.
```

### [7] SYSTEM-USER prompt · 2026-09-19 19:05:05 UTC

```
I need you to do two things:

1. Search the web for specific details about these HuggingFace datasets to confirm exact split sizes and structures:
   - THUDM/LongBench: total samples, task types, available configs, split structure
   - hotpotqa/hotpot_qa: exact train/val/test sizes for distractor config
   - google-research-datasets/natural_questions: exact split sizes and column names

2. Read the aii-hf-datasets skill scripts to understand the exact download/preview/search workflow, especially:
   - The file paths for scripts
   - How to use aii_hf_search_datasets.py, aii_hf_preview_datasets.py, aii_hf_download_datasets.py
   - Output file naming conventions

Search results: Use the aii_web_tools__search capability (call it with the search query). Or use the python script at /ai-inventor/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py

Report back exact numbers and structures.
```

### [8] SKILL-INPUT — aii-python · 2026-09-19 19:05:50 UTC

The agent loaded the **aii-python** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````

name: aii-python
description: "Applies this repo's Python conventions to experiment and evaluation scripts: uv-only environment setup (never pip), loguru logging with stdout plus a rotating file sink, @logger.catch(reraise=True) with explicit exception types, pathlib file access, type hints, and a standard main() script skeleton. ALWAYS read before writing or editing any Python script that runs an experiment, evaluation, or data-processing job. Triggers: writing or refactoring a Python script, uv venv, uv pip install, pyproject dependencies, loguru, logging setup, try/except and error handling, pathlib, script structure, Python 3.12. NOT for: parallelism, GPU throughput or hardware sizing (use aii-parallel-computing and aii-use-hardware), scaling long autonomous jobs (use aii-long-running-tasks), splitting oversized output files (use aii-file-size-limit), calling LLMs (use aii-openrouter-llms), or notebooks meant for Colab (use aii-colab)."
---

## Environment Setup

- Python 3.12+
- **NEVER use `pip` or `.venv/bin/pip`** — they are not installed. Use `uv` for ALL package operations:
  ```bash
  uv venv .venv --python=3.12
  source .venv/bin/activate  # or: .venv/bin/python script.py
  uv pip install pandas loguru  # NOT: pip install
  ```
- Create `.toml` file with dependencies, create uv `.venv` and activate it
- NO inline dependencies (no `# /// script` headers)

## Logging

Use `loguru` for all logging. Add a file sink alongside stdout.

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove()  # Remove default handler
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")
```

Rules:
- Log every major step (data loading, processing start/end, results)
- If applicable, log every LLM API call input and output
- Truncate long outputs in logs (add truncation logic for potentially large strings)
- Use `logger.error()` in except blocks (traceback auto-captured)

## Error Handling

- Wrap major operations in try/except blocks
- Use `@logger.catch(reraise=True)` decorator on main functions — without `reraise=True`, the script exits 0 even on uncaught exceptions, hiding failures from downstream consumers
- Use explicit exception types, not bare `except:`
- Never silently swallow exceptions — always log them

```python
@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    try:
        data = load_data(path)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error("Data file not found")
        raise
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logger.error("Invalid JSON in data file")
        raise
```

## Code Structure

- Use `pathlib.Path` for file operations: `Path("data/input.json").read_text()` not `open(...).read()`
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Use keyword arguments for functions with more than 4 parameters
- No hardcoded paths — derive from script location or accept as arguments

## Script Pattern

Standard pattern for experiment/evaluation scripts:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Brief description of what this script does."""

from loguru import logger
from pathlib import Path
import json
import sys

logger.remove()
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")

@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    # Load data
    data_path = Path("full_data_out.json")
    logger.info(f"Loading data from {data_path}")
    data = json.loads(data_path.read_text())
    logger.info(f"Loaded {len(data['examples'])} examples")

    # Process
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(data["examples"]):
        try:
            result = process(example)
            results.append(result)
        except Exception:
            logger.error(f"Failed on example {i}")
            continue

    # Save output
    output = {"examples": results}
    Path("method_out.json").write_text(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
    logger.info(f"Saved {len(results)} results")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

description: "Parallelises compute-heavy Python: asyncio with aiohttp and a bounded Semaphore for I/O-bound work, ProcessPoolExecutor under the spawn start method for CPU-bound work, NumPy vectorisation and batched PyTorch on GPU with an out-of-memory halving fallback. ALWAYS read before writing any script that loops over data, issues many API calls, downloads many files, or runs heavy computation — sequential loops are the default failure mode. Triggers: parallelise, make a slow script faster, concurrency, async, aiohttp, asyncio.gather, semaphore, multiprocessing, ProcessPoolExecutor, fork deadlock with loguru, worker count, batch size, CUDA out of memory, idle GPU, retries and rate limits. NOT for detecting what hardware exists or setting RAM and VRAM budgets (aii-use-hardware), staged scale-up against a time budget (aii-long-running-tasks), or provisioning cloud pods (aii-runpod)."
---

**ALWAYS parallelize. Sequential processing is unacceptable for any non-trivial workload.** A sequential script doing 1000 API calls takes hours and fails halfway. An async version finishes in minutes with proper error handling. ALWAYS ask: "Can this run in parallel?" — the answer is almost always yes.

Read aii-use-hardware skill first → get `NUM_CPUS`, `HAS_GPU`, `VRAM_GB`, `device`. Set `NUM_WORKERS` proportional to available CPU capacity — check `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)` and scale accordingly (e.g. 30% used → use ~70% of cores).

## Decision Tree (follow strictly)

- **I/O-bound** (API calls, downloads, web, file reads) → `asyncio` + `aiohttp` with `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`. NEVER do sequential HTTP requests in a loop.
- **CPU-bound, vectorizable** → GPU available: PyTorch on device / No GPU: NumPy vectorized ops. NEVER loop over array elements in Python.
- **CPU-bound, independent items** → `ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=NUM_WORKERS)`. NEVER process items one-by-one when they're independent.
- **Sequential** → only acceptable when items have data dependencies (each depends on the previous result).

## GPU Rules

- Use up to 90% of available VRAM — scale gradually (start small, increase after each successful run, keep 10% buffer)
- Move to device → compute → move back: `torch.tensor(data, device=device)` → `.cpu().numpy()`
- OOM fallback: catch `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` → `empty_cache()` → halve batch size → retry on GPU. Keep reducing until it fits. Stay on GPU.
- Batch large data: chunk it, `del batch` between iterations to free VRAM

## Parallelism Rules

- **CPU-bound**: `ProcessPoolExecutor` + `as_completed`, pre-allocate result list indexed by submission order
- **I/O-bound**: `asyncio` + `aiohttp`, `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`, single shared `ClientSession`, `asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)`
- Always add `tenacity` retries for transient failures, always set timeouts on HTTP requests
- **CRITICAL — `ProcessPoolExecutor` start method**: Default `fork` deadlocks with loguru (and any threading library). ALWAYS pass `mp_context=multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")` when constructing `ProcessPoolExecutor` in any script that uses loguru, threading, or async I/O. Example:
  ```python
  import multiprocessing as mp
  from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
  with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=N, mp_context=mp.get_context("spawn")) as pool:
      ...
  ```

## Contents

- Validating JSON (schema validation against experiment schemas)
- Formatting JSON (generate full/mini/preview versions)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:

export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --format {1} --file {2}' ::: 'exp_sel_data_out' 'exp_gen_sol_out' 'exp_eval_sol_out' :::+ '/tmp/full_data_out.json' '/tmp/method_out.json' '/tmp/eval_out.json'
```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Experiment Pipeline** — the four formats `schemas/` actually holds and
`AVAILABLE_FORMATS` in `scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py` accepts (this
list used to name six hypothesis-selection schemas that exist nowhere and
omit the proof one; corrected 2026-09-03):
- `exp_sel_data_out.json` - Experiment Data Selection format
- `exp_gen_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Generation format
- `exp_eval_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Evaluation format
- `exp_proof_out.json` - Experiment Proof format

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

kind: hypothesis
title: Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression
hypothesis: >-
  A target LLM's own next-token prediction surprisal (negative log-likelihood) on its input prompt provides a more accurate
  importance signal for hard token pruning than any proxy model's perplexity, because it directly measures what the target
  model itself finds predictable versus surprising — eliminating the proxy-model mismatch that plagues current methods like
  LLMLingua and SelectiveContext.
motivation: >-
  All existing hard prompt compression methods (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua, LLMLingua-2, SelectiveContext, ProCut) rely on a
  smaller proxy model (GPT-2, BERT, or fine-tuned small LM) to score token importance via perplexity or self-information.
  This creates a fundamental proxy-model mismatch: the proxy's predictions don't match the target LLM's, leading to suboptimal
  pruning. Meanwhile, soft prompt methods (SelfCP, ICAE, GIST) use the target LLM but produce dense vectors requiring learnable
  connectors and training. No method uses the target LLM's own next-token logits to directly compute per-token surprisal for
  hard token pruning. Predictive coding theory from neuroscience suggests that only 'surprising' inputs (high prediction error)
  carry new information for a predictive system; tokens the model predicts well are self-redundant. This hypothesis bridges
  that gap.
assumptions:
- >-
  Target LLM exposes next-token logits/probabilities for prompt tokens (available for local models via HuggingFace, some APIs)
- >-
  Surprisal computed as -log P(token | preceding context) under the target LLM's own distribution correlates with token importance
  for that model's generation
- >-
  Low-surprisal tokens are genuinely self-redundant for the target model (not just predictable in general)
- >-
  Hard token pruning based on self-surprisal preserves task performance better than proxy-model perplexity at equal compression
  ratios
- >-
  Single forward pass to compute all token surprisals is computationally feasible within budget
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Implement Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (SSHPC): for each prompt token, compute -log P(token | preceding context)
  using target LLM's forward pass; prune lowest-surprisal tokens to target compression ratio. 2. Compare against LLMLingua,
  LLMLingua-2, SelectiveContext, and random pruning baselines on LongBench, NaturalQuestions, GSM8K, and HotpotQA. 3. Test
  across multiple target LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Qwen2-7B, Mistral-7B) and compression ratios (2x, 4x, 8x, 10x). 4. Measure task
  accuracy, hallucination rate, and inference latency. 5. Ablate: compare self-surprisal vs. proxy-model perplexity on same
  target LLM to isolate proxy-mismatch effect.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) SSHPC matches or exceeds LLMLingua-2 task accuracy at equal/higher compression ratios on >=3/4 benchmarks;
  (b) SSHPC outperforms proxy-model baselines by >=2% absolute accuracy at high compression (8x+); (c) Ablation shows proxy-model
  perplexity on same target LLM degrades vs self-surprisal, confirming proxy-mismatch as key factor. DISCONFIRMED if: SSHPC
  consistently underperforms proxy baselines, or self-surprisal correlates poorly with actual token importance measured via
  leave-one-out ablation.

  Fundamental Limits of Prompt Compression (Nagle et al., 2024): Rate-distortion framework — theoretical baseline, no self-surprisal
  method
inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer from neuroscience (predictive coding / Free Energy Principle) and information theory (rate-distortion).
  Predictive coding posits the brain minimizes surprisal by predicting next inputs; only prediction errors (high surprisal)
  propagate up the hierarchy — predictable inputs are 'explained away' as redundant. Applied to LLMs: tokens the target model
  predicts well from context carry little new information for its own generation. This is a Level 3 methodological transfer
  — importing the concrete mechanism of surprisal-based filtering from predictive coding directly as a hard prompt compression
  algorithm.
terms:
- term: Surprisal (Self-Information)
  definition: >-
    Negative log-likelihood of a token under the model's next-token prediction distribution: -log P(token | preceding context).
    Measures how 'surprised' the model is by that token given its context.
- term: Proxy-Model Mismatch
  definition: >-
    The gap between a smaller proxy model's (e.g., GPT-2) token importance scores and the target LLM's (e.g., Llama-3-8B)
    actual sensitivity to those tokens, causing suboptimal pruning decisions.
- term: Hard Prompt Compression
  definition: >-
    Removing discrete tokens from the original natural language prompt while keeping remaining tokens unchanged — as opposed
    to soft prompt compression which produces continuous dense vectors.
- term: Predictive Coding
  definition: >-
    Neuroscience theory where hierarchical neural systems minimize free energy by predicting incoming sensory inputs; only
    prediction errors (surprisal) are forwarded, making predictable inputs informationally redundant for that system.
- term: Rate-Distortion Theory
  definition: >-
    Information-theoretic framework characterizing the fundamental trade-off between compression rate (bits) and distortion
    (fidelity loss) for a given source and distortion measure.
summary: >-
  Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (SSHPC) uses the target LLM's own next-token prediction logits to compute per-token
  surprisal on the input prompt, then prunes the most predictable (lowest surprisal) tokens. This eliminates the proxy-model
  mismatch that limits LLMLingua, SelectiveContext, and LLMLingua-2, while avoiding the training overhead and soft-token complexity
  of methods like SelfCP. Grounded in predictive coding theory from neuroscience.
alternates:
- title: Query-Conditioned Self-Surprisal
  hypothesis: >-
    Computing token surprisal conditioned on the query/task (P(token | context + query)) rather than context alone yields
    better pruning for query-aware tasks like QA and RAG, because it captures what's surprising specifically for the downstream
    task.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If query-specific information is the primary driver of token importance (as LongLLMLingua's question-aware compression
    shows), conditioning surprisal on the query could outperform unconditional self-surprisal, especially for RAG and multi-document
    QA where most context is irrelevant to the query.
- title: Attention-Weighted Self-Surprisal
  hypothesis: >-
    Weighting each token's self-surprisal by its attention mass (how much subsequent tokens attend to it) produces a more
    accurate importance score than raw surprisal alone, because it captures both self-predictability and causal influence
    on generation.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If some low-surprisal tokens are causally critical (e.g., rare but pivotal keywords that subsequent tokens heavily attend
    to), pure surprisal would incorrectly prune them. Attention-weighting corrects this by incorporating the target LLM's
    own causal dependency structure.
- title: Iterative Self-Surprisal Refinement
  hypothesis: >-
    Iteratively recomputing self-surprisal after each pruning round (since context changes) yields better compression than
    single-pass scoring, because token predictability shifts as surrounding tokens are removed.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If token surprisal is highly context-dependent (as LLMLingua's iterative compression suggests), single-pass scoring based
    on the original context becomes stale. Iterative recomputation adapts to the evolving compressed context, potentially
    enabling higher compression ratios with less performance loss.

  Download and standardize four benchmark datasets (LongBench, GSM8K, HotpotQA, NaturalQuestions) into a common format with
  train/validation/test splits, prompt templates for each task type (QA, reasoning, multi-hop), and metadata for compression
  evaluation.
approach: >-
  Use HuggingFace datasets library to load: (1) LongBench (21 tasks, 4750 samples) from THUDM/LongBench - select HotpotQA,
  2WikiMultihopQA, MuSiQue, MultiFieldQA-en, GSM8K, NarrativeQA, Qasper for diverse task types; (2) GSM8K (7473 train, 1319

</artifact_direction>



<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

DATASET executor scope:
  Output: data_out.json with rows of {input, output, metadata_fold, ...} — raw data only, no derived computations
  DOES: Download/generate datasets, analyze candidates to pick the best ones, standardize to JSON schema (features, labels, folds, metadata), validate schema, split into full/mini/preview
  DOES NOT: Run experiments, train models, compute derived statistics (PID/MI/correlations/synergy matrices) as final output
  If you need to COMPUTE something from data (synergy matrices, MI scores, timing benchmarks), use an EXPERIMENT artifact instead
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
DATASET:
- Plan for REAL third-party datasets (HuggingFace, Kaggle, direct-download URLs) — downloadable within time and size constraints
- Describe dataset criteria (domain, size, format) — executors find exact sources, but you can suggest candidates or search directions
- ALWAYS prefer real datasets over synthetic. Synthetic is a LAST RESORT only when no suitable real data exists
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

description: "Detects the CPU, RAM, GPU and VRAM actually available — cgroup v1 and v2 container quotas and CPU affinity rather than misleading host values — then sets RAM and VRAM budgets via resource.setrlimit and torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction so a script raises a catchable error instead of being OOM-killed, and picks the right torch wheel for the detected device.

---

**Step 1** — Run `bash scripts/get_hardware.sh` (relative to this skill's directory).

Read the `=== CGROUP ===` section carefully. If `Type: cgroup v1` or `cgroup v2`:
- You are in a **container with hard resource limits**. Exceeding them = OOM kill, no recovery.
- **Never** use `psutil.virtual_memory().total`, `free -h`, `/proc/meminfo`, `os.cpu_count()`, or `nproc` for resource limits — these report **host** values, not your container's allocation.
- **Always** read limits from the cgroup paths shown in the output, or use the Python helpers below.
- For **runtime memory monitoring**, read current usage from cgroup too:
  - v2: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.current`
  - v1: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.usage_in_bytes`

**Step 2** — Use Step 1 results to pick package variants **before** installing.

Defaults often target the most powerful environment — PyPI's `torch` ships with CUDA libs even on CPU-only hosts. Wrong variant = wasted disk, slow setup, possible import-time failures.

If `=== GPU ===` shows `No GPU`, install torch's CPU build (skips ~4.5GB of CUDA libs):
```bash
uv pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
Same idea for any library whose wheel selection depends on detected hardware (GPU/CPU-only builds, architecture-specific wheels).

After install, sanity-check imports right away (`python -c "import torch"`). Disk-pressure or interrupted installs leave half-built wheels (e.g. `libtorch_global_deps.so` missing) — catch these before the experiment runs.

**Step 3** — Set Python constants from the Step 1 results:
```python
import os, math, torch, psutil
from pathlib import Path

def _detect_cpus() -> int:

## Step 4 — Set Memory Limits

OOM kills the entire container. **Every script MUST set RAM and VRAM limits at startup.**

Decide the budget based on what the script actually needs. Estimate data size × 2-5x for in-memory overhead, then add ~50% breathing room for temporaries. You may use up to 90% of available RAM/VRAM, but **scale gradually** — start small (e.g. 30-50%), verify it works, then increase toward the limit. Never exceed 90% to keep a buffer for the OS, system processes, and the agent runtime itself. Going over crashes the container/machine with no recovery.

```python
import resource, psutil

_avail = psutil.virtual_memory().available
RAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate what this script needs (in bytes)
assert RAM_BUDGET < _avail, f"Budget {RAM_BUDGET/1e9:.1f}GB > available {_avail/1e9:.1f}GB"
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (RAM_BUDGET * 3, RAM_BUDGET * 3))  # 3x: virtual > RSS; raises MemoryError on exceed

if HAS_GPU:
    _free, _total = torch.cuda.mem_get_info(0)
    VRAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate GPU memory needs
    torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(min(VRAM_BUDGET / _total, 0.95))  # raises OutOfMemoryError on exceed
```

## Memory-Safe Data Processing

- **One at a time**: load one large object → process → `del obj; gc.collect()` → next
- **Load only what you need**: select specific tables/columns/rows, not entire databases
- **Test small first**: run on a sample before scaling to full data to estimate memory/time
- **Free intermediates in loops**: don't accumulate large results — aggregate incrementally
- **Size before loading**: check file/dataset size before loading; if it's >30% of `RAM_BUDGET`, chunk it

## Common Mistakes (from real crashes)

- **Skipping this skill entirely** — loading data with no RAM detection, no limits, no budget. Container OOM-killed, all agents lost.
- **Using `psutil.virtual_memory().total` instead of `_container_ram_gb()`** — reports host RAM (e.g. 66 GB) when container limit is 28 GB. You MUST use the cgroup-aware functions above.
- **Loading all tables from a multi-table database at once** — one agent loaded 14 RelBench tables simultaneously, spiked past container limit.
- **Setting no memory limits** — without `resource.setrlimit` (RAM) and `set_per_process_memory_fraction` (VRAM), a runaway script OOM-kills the container instead of raising a catchable error.
- **Using `os.cpu_count()` directly** — returns host CPUs (e.g. 192) instead of container limit (e.g. 4) on RunPod/Docker. Always use `_detect_cpus()` above which checks cgroup quota → CPU affinity → `os.cpu_count()` in order.

## Hardware Use

- Keep these results in mind for ALL subsequent tasks — don't assume more than detected
- GPU if available and parallelizable, multiprocessing if multiple CPUs
- Push available resources to their full potential — don't leave hardware idle

I need you to research four benchmark datasets by searching the web. Use the aii-web-tools skill scripts. Set PY and SKILL_DIR env vars as described:

SKILL_DIR="/ai-inventor/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"

Run these searches in parallel (use & or background):
1. $PY $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py --query "THUDM LongBench dataset HuggingFace tasks samples" --max-results 5
2. $PY $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py --query "openai GSM8K dataset HuggingFace train test split size" --max-results 5
3. $PY $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py --query "hotpotQA distractor subset HuggingFace dataset structure" --max-results 5
4. $PY $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py --query "NaturalQuestions google-research-datasets HuggingFace splits samples" --max-results 5

For each result, also fetch the HuggingFace dataset page to get exact sample formats and field names. Return a structured summary with exact numbers.
```

Research the four benchmark datasets for LLM prompt compression using HuggingFace datasets library and web search. I need exact information about:

1. LongBench (THUDM/LongBench): Total samples, task types available, split structure, sample format
2. openai/gsm8k: Train/test split sizes, sample fields
3. hotpotqa/hotpot_qa (distractor subset): Train/val/test sizes, sample fields
4. google-research-datasets/natural_questions: Train/val/test sizes, sample fields

Use the following approach:
- Use `python -c` with huggingface_hub to get dataset info and configs
- Use the aii-hf-datasets skill scripts for preview
- Use web search for cross-referencing

Return a structured summary with: exact dataset IDs, config names, split sizes, sample fields/format, and any special considerations (long context, encoding issues).

Attempt 1 failed validation.

Schema validation found 3 problems — fix ALL of them at once:
  - at `<root>`: 'ideal_dataset_criteria' is a required property
  - at `<root>`: 'dataset_search_plan' is a required property
  - at `<root>`: 'target_num_datasets' is a required property
Every required field must be present and every field type must match the schema.

Produce `.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json` again so it contains corrected JSON that matches the schema. Do not invent new fields.
