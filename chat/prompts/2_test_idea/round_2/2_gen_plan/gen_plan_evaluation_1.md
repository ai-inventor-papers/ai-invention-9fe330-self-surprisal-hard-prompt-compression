title: Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression
hypothesis: >-
  A target LLM's own next-token prediction surprisal (negative log-likelihood) on its input prompt provides a more accurate
  importance signal for hard token pruning than any proxy model's perplexity, because it directly measures what the target
  model itself finds predictable versus surprising — eliminating the proxy-model mismatch that plagues current methods like
  LLMLingua and SelectiveContext. SSHPC uses iterative re-scoring at high compression ratios (>=8x) where single-pass context
  dependence degrades rankings, preserves special/instruction tokens by assigning infinite surprisal, generalizes query-conditioning
  to arbitrary task specifications (last user message, instruction prefix), and measures actual prefill latency against generation
  savings to establish a break-even compression ratio. This operationalizes the rate-distortion principle (Nagle et al., 2024)
  and SelfCP's target-model compressor insight as a training-free hard-pruning method.
motivation: >-
  All existing hard prompt compression methods (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua, LLMLingua-2, SelectiveContext, ProCut) rely on a
  smaller proxy model (GPT-2, BERT, or fine-tuned small LM) to score token importance via perplexity or self-information.
  This creates a fundamental proxy-model mismatch: the proxy's predictions don't match the target LLM's, leading to suboptimal
  pruning. Meanwhile, soft prompt methods (SelfCP, ICAE, GIST) use the target LLM but produce dense vectors requiring learnable
  connectors and training. No method uses the target LLM's own next-token logits to directly compute per-token surprisal for
  hard token pruning. Predictive coding theory from neuroscience suggests that only 'surprising' inputs (high prediction error)
  carry new information for a predictive system; tokens the model predicts well are self-redundant. This hypothesis bridges
  that gap.
assumptions:
- >-
  Target LLM exposes next-token logits/probabilities for prompt tokens (available for local models via HuggingFace, some APIs)
- >-
  Surprisal computed as -log P(token | preceding context) under the target LLM's own distribution correlates with token importance
  for that model's generation
- >-
  Low-surprisal tokens are genuinely self-redundant for the target model (not just predictable in general)
- >-
  Hard token pruning based on self-surprisal preserves task performance better than proxy-model perplexity at equal compression
  ratios
- >-
  Single forward pass to compute all token surprisals is computationally feasible within budget
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Implement Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (SSHPC): for each prompt token, compute -log P(token | preceding context)
  using target LLM's forward pass; prune lowest-surprisal tokens to target compression ratio. 2. Compare against LLMLingua,
  LLMLingua-2, SelectiveContext, and random pruning baselines on LongBench, NaturalQuestions, GSM8K, and HotpotQA. 3. Test
  across multiple target LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Qwen2-7B, Mistral-7B) and compression ratios (2x, 4x, 8x, 10x). 4. Measure task
  accuracy, hallucination rate, and inference latency. 5. Ablate: compare self-surprisal vs. proxy-model perplexity on same
  target LLM to isolate proxy-mismatch effect.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) SSHPC matches or exceeds LLMLingua-2 task accuracy at equal/higher compression ratios on >=3/4 benchmarks;
  (b) SSHPC outperforms proxy-model baselines by >=2% absolute accuracy at high compression (8x+); (c) Ablation shows proxy-model
  perplexity on same target LLM degrades vs self-surprisal, confirming proxy-mismatch as key factor. DISCONFIRMED if: SSHPC
  consistently underperforms proxy baselines, or self-surprisal correlates poorly with actual token importance measured via
  leave-one-out ablation.

- >-
  Fundamental Limits of Prompt Compression (Nagle et al., 2024): Rate-distortion framework — theoretical baseline, no self-surprisal
  method
inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer from neuroscience (predictive coding / Free Energy Principle) and information theory (rate-distortion).
  Predictive coding posits the brain minimizes surprisal by predicting next inputs; only prediction errors (high surprisal)
  propagate up the hierarchy — predictable inputs are 'explained away' as redundant. Applied to LLMs: tokens the target model
  predicts well from context carry little new information for its own generation. This is a Level 3 methodological transfer
  — importing the concrete mechanism of surprisal-based filtering from predictive coding directly as a hard prompt compression
  algorithm.
terms:
- term: Surprisal (Self-Information)
  definition: >-
    Negative log-likelihood of a token under the model's next-token prediction distribution: -log P(token | preceding context).
    Measures how 'surprised' the model is by that token given its context.
- term: Proxy-Model Mismatch
  definition: >-
    The gap between a smaller proxy model's (e.g., GPT-2) token importance scores and the target LLM's (e.g., Llama-3-8B)
    actual sensitivity to those tokens, causing suboptimal pruning decisions.
- term: Hard Prompt Compression
  definition: >-
    Removing discrete tokens from the original natural language prompt while keeping remaining tokens unchanged — as opposed
    to soft prompt compression which produces continuous dense vectors.
- term: Predictive Coding
  definition: >-
    Neuroscience theory where hierarchical neural systems minimize free energy by predicting incoming sensory inputs; only
    prediction errors (surprisal) are forwarded, making predictable inputs informationally redundant for that system.
- term: Rate-Distortion Theory
  definition: >-
    Information-theoretic framework characterizing the fundamental trade-off between compression rate (bits) and distortion
    (fidelity loss) for a given source and distortion measure.
summary: >-
  Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (SSHPC) uses the target LLM's own next-token prediction logits to compute per-token
  surprisal on the input prompt, then prunes the most predictable (lowest surprisal) tokens. This eliminates the proxy-model
  mismatch that limits LLMLingua, SelectiveContext, and LLMLingua-2, while avoiding the training overhead and soft-token complexity
  of methods like SelfCP. Grounded in predictive coding theory from neuroscience.
alternates:
- title: Query-Conditioned Self-Surprisal
  hypothesis: >-
    Computing token surprisal conditioned on the query/task (P(token | context + query)) rather than context alone yields
    better pruning for query-aware tasks like QA and RAG, because it captures what's surprising specifically for the downstream
    task.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If query-specific information is the primary driver of token importance (as LongLLMLingua's question-aware compression
    shows), conditioning surprisal on the query could outperform unconditional self-surprisal, especially for RAG and multi-document
    QA where most context is irrelevant to the query.
- title: Attention-Weighted Self-Surprisal
  hypothesis: >-
    Weighting each token's self-surprisal by its attention mass (how much subsequent tokens attend to it) produces a more
    accurate importance score than raw surprisal alone, because it captures both self-predictability and causal influence
    on generation.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If some low-surprisal tokens are causally critical (e.g., rare but pivotal keywords that subsequent tokens heavily attend
    to), pure surprisal would incorrectly prune them. Attention-weighting corrects this by incorporating the target LLM's
    own causal dependency structure.
- title: Iterative Self-Surprisal Refinement
  hypothesis: >-
    Iteratively recomputing self-surprisal after each pruning round (since context changes) yields better compression than
    single-pass scoring, because token predictability shifts as surrounding tokens are removed.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If token surprisal is highly context-dependent (as LLMLingua's iterative compression suggests), single-pass scoring based
    on the original context becomes stale. Iterative recomputation adapts to the evolving compressed context, potentially
    enabling higher compression ratios with less performance loss.
_relation_rationale: >-
  Refines methodology while keeping SSHPC core claim; addresses reviewer's experimental defects.
_confidence_delta: decreased
_key_changes:
- >-
  Added iterative re-scoring as default for compression >=8x to fix single-pass context dependence
- >-
  Special/instruction tokens preserved by infinite surprisal assignment (fixes first-token gap)
- >-
  Query-conditioning generalized to any task specification (last user message, instruction prefix)
- >-
  Explicit latency measurement: prefill time vs. generation savings to find break-even ratio
- >-
  Novelty reframed: hard-token operationalization of SelfCP/rate-distortion principle, not wholly new idea
- >-
  Proxy-on-target ablation clarified: granularity (token vs segment) and iterative conditioning are key differences
- >-
  Removed projected numbers; success criteria now tied to actual experimental execution
_evidence_state: experiment_broken
_move: fix
_move_rationale: >-
  No experiments ran; all quantitative claims are projected placeholders. The test never tested the claim. Next iteration
  must execute the experimental plan with the methodological fixes above.
_coverage: lost
_coverage_statement: >-
  The user asked for a survey of simple prompt-compression techniques; this hypothesis proposes a novel method instead. The
  next iteration must either pivot to a survey deliverable or acknowledge SSHPC as a separate research direction.

objective: >-
  Analyze experimental results with statistical rigor: compare SSHPC vs baselines at each compression ratio, isolate proxy-mismatch
  effect via proxy-on-target ablation, verify iterative re-scoring benefit at >=8x, compute break-even compression ratio from
  latency measurements, generate publication-ready figures.

  tests (10k resamples) for SSHPC vs each baseline; (3) Proxy-mismatch isolation: compare SSHPC vs proxy-on-target ablation
  (same target LLM) to quantify mismatch effect; (4) Iterative benefit: single-pass vs iterative at 8x/10x; (5) Latency break-even:
  plot prefill time vs generation savings, find ratio where compression overhead = generation time saved; (6) Surprisal distribution

<instructions>
YOUR ROLE: Write a detailed PLAN for the artifact. A separate executor agent runs the actual artifact later.

You are a PLANNER, not an executor. Your output is a plan that tells the executor what to do and how.
Do NOT execute the artifact itself — a separate agent handles that. Your job is to plan it so well that the executor can follow your plan step by step.

You CAN and SHOULD: search the web, read papers, and explore library docs to make your plan concrete.
You CANNOT run shell commands or scripts — code execution is disabled. Research via web tools only.

Do NOT do the executor's job: don't download datasets, don't implement code, don't run experiments, don't write proofs, don't compute evaluations.

<artifact_executor_scope>
IMPORTANT: Each artifact executor has a focused prompt that guides it to do ONE thing well. It will NOT perform tasks outside its scope — assigning the wrong work to the wrong artifact type wastes an iteration. Match the task to the right executor.

EVALUATION executor scope:
  Output: eval_out.json with evaluation results
  DOES: Any evaluation of experiment results — metrics, statistical tests, ablations, comparisons, visualizations, robustness checks, error analysis, etc.
  DOES NOT: Implement new methods (use EXPERIMENT), collect data (use DATASET)
  This is for analyzing experiment outputs from any angle
</artifact_executor_scope>

<artifact_planning_rules>
EVALUATION: Must depend on at least one EXPERIMENT. Focus on statistical rigor and validity checks.
</artifact_planning_rules>


GOOD PLANS: specific, actionable, consider failure scenarios, build on the suggested approach.
BAD PLANS: vague hand-waving, ignoring the suggested approach, missing critical executor details.

# Computational linguistics — field handbook

## Overview

Scope: computational linguistics as a SCIENCE of language — what models reveal about language and
about human language processing, and how such claims are measured. NLP engineering (training,
prompting, retrieval, agents) is out of scope. The star is the SUBSTRATE below: a dated,
source-anchored map with an explicit do-not-redo list. The only IDEATION lens is open questions;
a thin execution floor follows it.

**How to use this map.** It is a STARTING POINT, not a substitute for looking. Its crowded
list is necessarily incomplete and its frontier is dated; map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,
never *open*. Before committing to any direction, run your own fresh, dated saturation search
on that specific direction and confirm it is actually unoccupied. Treat the sections below as
material to reason against — the questions especially — rather than as conclusions to accept.

## Organizing principles (how the field reasons)

- **The measurement instrument is itself under audit.** A 445-benchmark, 29-reviewer systematic review found "patterns
  related to the measured phenomena, tasks, and scoring metrics which undermine the validity of the
  resulting claims" [S2] — a capability claim is judged on its construct, not just its number.
- **Output is not competence.** "LLMs' metalinguistic judgments are inferior to quantities directly
  derived from representations" [S3]; grammaticality separates in hidden states where string
  probability does not [S12].
- **A negative result about a model is a claim about your probe:** "negative results relying on
  metalinguistic prompts cannot be taken as conclusive evidence that an LLM lacks a particular
  linguistic generalization" [S3].
- **Disagreement is data.** Human label variation "reflects the diversity of human perspectives
  rather than mere error"; collapsing it manufactures "artificial consensus" [S7].
- **Explanatory status is graded, and the grades are named.** LLMs supply "how-possibly
  explanations (HPEs)" about acquisition and competence, while "current LLMs do not yet satisfy"
  the requirements for how-actually explanations [S4].
- **Theory bounds the empirics** — expressivity results explain "why current transformer
  architectures struggle to implement exact discrete algorithms" [S24] — but they are
  assumption-relative by construction [S11].

## Frontier (recency-weighted)

**Measurement & construct validity** *(weight-capped — the loudest thread)*

- A systematic review of 445 LLM benchmarks by 29 expert reviewers found validity-undermining
  patterns across measured phenomena, tasks and scoring metrics [S2] (NeurIPS 2025).
- The JUDGe 2026 workshop frames judge validity as a systems property: "Evaluation validity is not a property of
  a judge in isolation" [S25] (2026). Peer-reviewed baseline beneath it: reliability varies by
  property, judge expertise, and whether text is human- or model-generated [S21] (ACL 2025).
- Contamination has its own position paper, which sets out to "highlight the wide prevalence of
  benchmark dataset contamination and outline the properties of contamination-resistant datasets"
  [S14] (ICML 2026 Position Track).

**What LMs represent vs what they output**

- A grammaticality probe "outperforms LM probability-based grammaticality judgments" — yet
  on semantic plausibility "the probe however performs worse than string probability" [S12] (2026-05).
- ACL 2026's Best Paper found a directional semantic failure: a "pervasive Teleological Bias" where
  models "hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events, even overriding explicit textual
  cancellation"; prompting interventions "partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration
  crisis" [S8] (2026).

**Cognitive modelling and the scale paradox**

- Surprisal's fit to reading times peaks near two billion training tokens, after which perplexity
  gains produce "poorer fits to human reading times" [S16] (Findings of EMNLP 2023).
- Not an artifact of latency measures — the inverse relation "still obtains" on two fMRI datasets
  across 17 LMs [S17] (EACL 2026).
- The predictor is unstable: early-layer representations beat surprisal on early-pass eye movements,
  and "the best-performing predictor varies strongly depending on the language and eye-tracking
  measure" [S23] (ACL 2026).

**The resource map and language varieties**

- Catalogue counts mislead: 59% of the surveyed languages score zero catalogued-dataset density, yet literature mining shows active dataset production for many [S5] (2026-05).
- The dominant multilingual benchmark is criticized at protocol level — many translations "fall below
  the claimed 90% quality standard", and "copying named entities, can yield non-trivial BLEU
  scores" [S13] (EMNLP 2025).

**Annotation, disagreement, pluralism**

- The perspectivist turn has its own survey, mapping "a shift from consensus learning toward
  explicitly modeling disagreement, and toward capturing structured relationships among
  annotators" [S6] (2026-01).

**Meta-science of the field**

- Submission volume outran reviewing capacity — 17,087 submissions against 1,424 area chairs,
  with the community weighing "options for limiting submissions for the first time in ACL's
  history" [S1] (2026-05) — yet measured review quality shows "no consistent decline in median
  review quality across venues and years" [S22] (2026-01). ACL 2026's special theme was model
  explainability [S10].

## Recent (~1–2 yr, compressed) · Durable core

- Durable and still load-bearing: surprisal theory as the LM-to-processing-cost bridge [S16];
  minimal-pair evaluation as the standard syntactic instrument [S12]; direct probability
  measurement as the stronger read-out of linguistic knowledge [S3]; the child-learning data
  bound — "less than 100 million words" — with curriculum learning, heavily attempted,
  "largely unsuccessful" [S18].
- The three standing stances on LLMs and linguistic theory [S4]: **insulationism** (LLMs are
  irrelevant to human language), **eliminativism** (they can replace traditional linguistic
  theories), **conciliationism** (they are useful tools for linguistic research).

## ⛔ Already crowded — go ELSEWHERE (do-not-redo)

The blank space is NOT in these lanes; each is saturated through H1-2026:

- **Creating another multilingual / low-resource benchmark.** Dense and institutionalized: the
  FLORES+ family plus its published protocol critique [S13], variety-level suites [S19], and
  and a 232-paper survey of the multilingual/edge pipeline [S20].
- **Benchmark-contamination detection.** Saturated; the prevalence of contamination and the
  properties of resistant datasets are already laid out in a peer-reviewed position paper [S14].
- **LLM-as-judge meta-evaluation and bias catalogues.** A 20-dataset / 11-model peer-reviewed study
  [S21] plus a dedicated 2026 workshop [S25] own this.
- **Minimal-pair grammaticality evaluation and its representation-level follow-up.** Models already
  "discriminate well between grammatical and ungrammatical sentences in tightly controlled minimal
  pairs", and the probe-vs-probability comparison is published [S12].
- **Human label variation / perspectivist modelling.** Mapped end-to-end by its own survey [S6] and
  already escalated into post-training [S7].
- **Computational morphology and low-resource dependency parsing.** Both have their own survey and
  a 2026 cross-architecture evaluation [S29] [S30].
- **Computational sociolinguistics / dialect NLP.** Mapped by its own survey [S27], with a
  variety-level benchmark already published [S19].
- **Sign-language processing tooling and reproducibility.** The ad-hoc-code problem and a framework
  answer to it are published [S28].
- **Language-documentation annotation tooling.** 98 tools already surveyed against documentary
  requirements [S26].
- **Coreference and discourse resolution.** A shared-task series in its fifth edition, with a 2026
  benchmark wave alongside it [S31].
- **Diachronic / lexical semantic change.** Mature enough that its canonical benchmark is itself
  under published critique, with a dedicated workshop series [S32].
- **Surprisal-vs-reading-time psychometrics.** The inverse-scaling result, its tipping point, its
  fMRI generalization, and its layerwise refinement are all published [S16] [S17] [S23].

> **Standing directive — this list is necessarily INCOMPLETE.** Map-silence means *not-yet-checked*,
> NOT *open*. Before committing to any direction this map does not explicitly flag as crowded, run a
> fresh, dated saturation search and confirm the space is actually unoccupied. (Measured in this forge's own
> A/B runs: a live-searching baseline beats a static handbook precisely on the crowded lanes a map omits.)

## Open questions the field hasn't answered

*(the whole lens — the reader answers in their own way)*

1. Prompted output underestimates linguistic knowledge [S3], and grammaticality separates in hidden
   states where string probability does not [S12]. **Is the observable this field treats as its
   measurement — model output, or string probability — even the right object for a claim about
   linguistic competence?** Instruments changed without this being settled.
2. If a review of 445 benchmarks finds validity-undermining patterns [S2] while judge validity is a
   property of a whole pipeline rather than a judge [S25], what would a capability claim here have
   to report before it should be believed?
3. LLMs supply how-possibly but not how-actually explanations of language [S4]. What evidence would
   move a computational result across that line, and does any current design even address it?
4. The best cognitive predictor is a deliberately undertrained model [S16] [S17], while the strongest
   predictor varies by layer, language, and measure [S23]. What is being modelled when psychometric
   fit and language-modelling quality pull in opposite directions?
5. Catalogue counts and literature evidence disagree about which languages are resourced [S5], and
   the dominant benchmark is protocol-flawed for exactly those languages [S13]. Is "low-resource" a
   property of languages, of documentation infrastructure, or of evaluation design?
6. Submission volume outran reviewing capacity to the point of considering caps [S1], yet measured
   review quality has not declined [S22]. If the bottleneck is not quality, what is the constraint
   actually selecting for in what gets published?

## What counts as DEEP here (taste)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Add a benchmark, a language, or a model to an existing evaluation and report the numbers. | *Computational Linguistics* prints the bar for a **squib**: "unexpectedness, as for example a demonstration that a commonly accepted idea or method is flawed", or "genuine novelty, as for example thus-far unnoticed language data that challenges current methods". Not "more coverage". | problematizes-nothing — coverage counts only if it breaks something | A | [S9] |
| Probe an LLM on a linguistic phenomenon and report accuracy. | The ACL 2026 **Best Paper** derived a diagnostic from linguistic theory, found a *systematic directional* failure — models "systematically hallucinate completion for goal-oriented events" — and showed prompting fixes "partially reduce this bias but trigger a calibration crisis". Theory-derived contrast plus a failure with a shape. | problematizes-nothing — an accuracy number on a new phenomenon is coverage | L | [S8] |
| Conclude from failed metalinguistic prompts that a model lacks a linguistic generalization. | **Buried (EMNLP 2023):** metalinguistic judgments are inferior to direct probability read-outs, and "consistency gets worse as the prompt query diverges from direct measurements of next-word probabilities". Reopening condition: the same negative result reproduced against direct probability measurement. | wrong-result — you measured the probe, not the model | L | [S3] |

> **Science-vs-application, as this field draws it:** the journal asks for a "substantive
> contribution to the computational processing of language" and clear unexpectedness, genuine
> novelty, or broad relevance [S9]. A working system with a headline number and no overturned
> assumption is application-tier — hence the separate resource, demo, and social-impact award
> tracks rather than one axis [S15].

## Critical rules (execution · eval · validity)

| Naive move | Expert judgment/move | Why (failure prevented) | tier | src |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Test linguistic knowledge by prompting the model to judge. | Designing the probe: read probabilities directly where possible; report prompting as a second, weaker measurement — never as sole evidence for absence. | wrong-result — negative results are unsound from prompts alone | L | [S3] |
| Report benchmark accuracy as a capability claim. | Writing the claim: define the construct, say how items operationalize it, and report uncertainty. | wrong-result — the score does not measure the named phenomenon | L | [S2] |
| Use FLORES+ as ground truth for low-resource MT quality. | Choosing the eval set: check quality and domain fit for your languages and add a naturalistic set — models strong on one can look weak on the other. | wrong-result — the benchmark's own quality bound caps your conclusion | L | [S13] |
| Aggregate annotations to a majority label by default. | Handling annotation: decide explicitly whether disagreement is error or signal for THIS task; preserve the distribution when it is signal. | wrong-result — artificial consensus erases the phenomenon | L | [S7] [S6] |
| Reach for a pretrained transformer parser on a low-resource language. | Choosing the architecture: below the data crossover a Biaffine LSTM beats transformers, and morphological complexity widens that disadvantage. | wasted-cost — the bigger model is the weaker one in that regime | L | [S30] |
| Call a language low-resource from catalogue counts. | Scoping resources: check literature-level dataset circulation, not just registered catalogues, before claiming a data gap. | wrong-result — the gap may be documentation, not data | L | [S5] |
| Argue cognitive plausibility from a bigger, better LM. | Making a processing claim: treat training data and model scale as deliberate variables and report layer and measure — the best predictor changes with both. | wrong-result — the inverse relation holds on latency and fMRI alike [S17]; fit peaks near 2B training tokens [S16] | L | [S16] [S17] [S23] |

## Decision guide

- **Competence vs performance:** for "does the model know X", read probabilities or probe
  representations [S3] [S12]; for "does it use X when generating", behavioral output is right —
  do not swap them.
- **Cognitive-modelling target:** latency and fMRI now agree on inverse scaling [S16] [S17]; early-
  vs late-pass measures disagree on the best predictor [S23] — name the measure before the model.
- **Aggregating annotations:** aggregate when the task has a defensible single answer; preserve the
  distribution when variation is interpretive [S6] [S7].
- **Placing yourself in the theory debate:** the field names three positions — insulationist,
  eliminativist, conciliationist [S4]; a paper implies one whether or not it says so.

## Ground rules (known-lane — terse)

- Surprisal = negative log probability of a word in context; the standard LM-to-processing-cost link [S16].
- Minimal pairs = near-identical sentences differing in acceptability; BLiMP-style suites are the
  canonical syntactic instrument [S12].
- Human label variation (HLV) = legitimate annotator disagreement, distinct from annotation error [S7].
- Construct validity = whether a measure represents the phenomenon it names; now a routine reviewer
  question in this field [S2].

## Reference documentation

- **[volatile.md](volatile.md)** — dated frontier numbers, lane-occupancy flags, and per-source
  review status. Re-check this FIRST before any novelty verdict or write-up.

## Candidate lane  ⚠️ (expert to resolve — NOT verified)

- ⚠️ **No peer-reviewed 2026 synthesis of "what computational linguistics is now" was recoverable
  this pass.** A Philosophy Compass survey of the philosophy of language models exists but was
  paywalled; the field-identity framing rests on one preprint [S4] plus venue artifacts [S9] [S10].
  Confirm before asserting a field-wide consensus in a write-up.
- ⚠️ **The ACL 2026 award slate could not be read with committee rationale** — the page lists titles
  only, so the taste row rests on the paper's own abstract [S8] plus the journal's printed criteria
  [S9], not a meta-review. Confirm/refute: an award rationale or area-chair commentary for ACL 2026.

# Data figures — charts rendered from their numbers

Deterministic figures from a JSON spec: the numbers go in, matplotlib draws
them, and the picture cannot disagree with the data. Nothing is generated by
a model, so a bar is the height of its value and every axis is computed.
Re-running a spec gives a byte-identical PNG; the PDF differs only in its
embedded creation timestamp.

## Data figure or concept figure?

| The figure is… | Use |
|---|---|
| A chart of numbers you have | **this skill** |
| A confusion matrix, ablation grid, correlation | **this skill** |
| A scaling law, training curve, Pareto trade-off | **this skill** |
| Artwork, a metaphor, a cover image | `aii-concept-fig-gen` |
| An architecture or flow diagram | `aii-concept-fig-gen` |

In that table **this skill** means a data figure and `aii-concept-fig-gen` a
concept figure. For an architecture or flow diagram, read *Limits* first.

The test is whether the figure has underlying numbers. If it does, an image
model will approximate them — bars that do not match their labels, axis
ticks that do not divide evenly, invented data points. That failure is
invisible to a reviewer of the prompt and obvious to a reviewer of the
paper.

## Use a generator when one fits — hand-write only when none does

The generators are a menu, not a fence. Every type below is a shortcut that
already has the house style, the data-integrity guards and the layout fixes
baked in, so reaching for one is almost always less work than plotting by
hand and the result is consistent with every other figure in the paper.

**Check `--list-types` first.** If a type matches what you need, use it.
Don't know the name? `--search "<the question your figure answers>"` ranks
the catalogue by intent rather than by name — `--search "before and after
per method"` puts `slope` first and `dumbbell` second.
Two-thirds of research figures are a bar, a line, a scatter or a heatmap,
and those are solved.

`--search` spans **two corpora** and labels every hit with which one it
came from:

| label | what it is | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| `ours: <type>` | one of our 61 types | `--example`, edit, render |
| `chartmimic: <task>/<id>` | a published figure | read its `.py` |

A `chartmimic:` hit is a **reference, not a spec.** It is a human-curated
figure from a STEM paper with the matplotlib that draws it — from
ChartMimic ([arXiv:2406.09961](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09961)), 4,800 of
them over 22 categories. Adapting one is a *hand-written* figure: no house
style, no data-integrity guards, no layout passes unless you call them, so
everything above about hand-written figures still applies. The search
prints the path to its code under every such hit. Generators outrank
exemplars on a tie, because a generator is the runnable answer.

Reach for an exemplar in exactly two cases: **nothing in the catalogue
fits** (see the gap table below), or you want to see how a published figure
did something — a twin axis, a labelled contour — in working code.
`--corpus ours|chartmimic|all` narrows the search; the default is `all`.

**If nothing fits, write matplotlib yourself** — that is expected and
supported, not a failure. Novel or one-off figures exist. When you do:

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "<skill>/scripts")
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from chart_geometry import assert_text_is_legible, fit_point_labels
from chart_style import (
    apply_house_style, PALETTE, literal, place_legend, place_point_label,
    fit_legends, clear_legends_of_data, fit_tick_labels, fit_titles,
    rasterize_dense_clouds, assert_legends_clear_of_data,
    assert_series_are_distinguishable, assert_axis_names_are_unique,
)

apply_house_style()                 # fonts, palette, grid, Type-42 PDF fonts
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7, 3.94), layout="constrained")
...
place_legend(ax, loc="best")        # a legend fit_legends can reflow
place_point_label(ax, literal("Ours"), (1, 2))   # a name, nudged off the data
fit_legends(fig)                    # reflow a legend wider than its axes
clear_legends_of_data(fig)          # move it below the axes if it sits on data
fit_tick_labels(fig)                # wrap/tilt tick labels that would collide
fit_titles(fig)                     # wrap any title wider than its axes
clear_legends_of_data(fig)          # AGAIN — the two above reshaped the axes
fit_point_labels(fig)               # move point names off markers and curves
rasterize_dense_clouds(fig)         # >25k points as a bitmap, text stays vector
assert_text_is_legible(fig)         # raises if any text collides or is cut off
assert_legends_clear_of_data(fig)   # raises if a legend still hides its data
assert_series_are_distinguishable(fig)  # raises on two identical legend keys
assert_axis_names_are_unique(fig)   # raises if one name labels two positions
fig.savefig("figX_v0.pdf")          # vector, so LaTeX renders text at page res
```

Call the fitters in that order — the legend decides how much room the axes
has, whether it then has to move out of the data is only knowable once it is
placed, tick labels change the axes height, the title is measured against the
axes it ends up on, and a point's name can only be placed once nothing above
it will move the point again. `clear_legends_of_data` appears TWICE on
purpose: it decides by measuring, and the two passes between its calls shrink
the axes under a legend that is already placed and a fixed size. A wrapped
title took a lone chart from 179 px of axes height to 141, and a legend that
covered nothing before covered half a curve after — with the mover's turn
already past, so the figure was refused rather than fixed. The first call
still has to happen first, because the room the legend needs is an input to
the passes below it. Two further gates are warning-based and so are
not in the snippet: `assert_layout_applied` and `assert_all_glyphs_rendered`
read what matplotlib warned about during the draw, so they need the figure
built inside `warnings.catch_warnings(record=True)` — worth doing, since a
missing glyph is only ever a warning and ships as a hollow box.
`place_legend` and `place_point_label` are how
the fitters find what to fix: a legend built with a bare `ax.legend` cannot
be reflowed, and a name written with a bare `ax.annotate` will not be moved
off the marker it landed on.

That keeps a hand-written figure looking like the rest of the paper and
still gets you colourblind-safe colours, submission-compliant fonts, no
clipped labels and no overprinted ones. What you lose is the data-integrity
checking — so verify the numbers yourself.

**If you hand-write the same figure type twice, add a renderer instead.**
`chart_renderers*.py` — one function, `(ax, spec) -> None`, registered in
its family's dict. That is how this catalogue got here.

## Use it

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-data-fig-gen"
G="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/chart_gen.py"

python "$G" --list-types            # the catalogue
python "$G" --search "compare distributions across groups"   # find it by intent
python "$G" --search "pie wedges" --corpus chartmimic         # exemplars only
python "$G" --audit                 # what ChartMimic has that we do not
python "$G" --example bar           # a complete spec to copy and edit
python "$G" --spec fig1.json --out figures/fig1
```

`python` here is the pipeline image's interpreter, which has matplotlib and
scipy installed system-wide. Outside the image use the project venv —
`.venv/bin/python` — since a bare `python3` will not have them.

Writes `figures/fig1.pdf` **and** `figures/fig1.png`. The PDF is the
deliverable — LaTeX renders vector text at page resolution, so it stays
sharp and selectable at any zoom. The PNG exists so you can read the figure
back and look at it.

`--format pdf`, `--format png`, `--format pdf,png,svg` narrows the output.
SVG keeps its labels as TEXT rather than paths, so it stays editable and
searchable. EPS is refused: the PostScript backend cannot draw transparency
and flattens it silently, which the house style uses on nine of every ten
figures — the file would not match the PNG you checked.
`--spec -` reads the spec from stdin.

Runs on `matplotlib` + `numpy`, both already `aii_pipeline` dependencies —
nothing to install.

## The catalogue

`--example <type>` prints a complete spec for any of these. The "choose it
over" half of each entry is the useful one: most figures have two plausible
types and the choice between them is what decides whether a reviewer reads
the point.

### Comparing categories

- `bar` — draws: Vertical bars, grouped or stacked, optional error bars.
  Choose it over: The default. `barh` if names are long.
- `barh` — draws: Horizontal bars — labels on the y-axis with room to run.
  Choose it over: `bar`, whenever names exceed ~40 chars, or for a ranking.
- `lollipop` — draws: A stem and a dot per category. Choose it over: `barh`,
  past ~20 categories, where bars become a picket fence.
- `dumbbell` — draws: Two markers per row joined by a line. Choose it over:
  Paired bars, when the GAP between them is the story.
- `slope` — draws: One line per item from a before value to an after value.
  Choose it over: Paired bars, when which items changed RANK is the story.
- `bump` — draws: Rank against time, one line per item; the crossings are
  the finding. Choose it over: `slope`, which shows a reordering for exactly
  TWO time points and cannot show the path between more.
- `volcano` — draws: Effect size against significance, with both thresholds
  drawn. Choose it over: A `bar` of effects, which cannot show what survived
  correction, or a table of p-values, which cannot show what was big enough
  to matter.
- `diverging` — draws: Signed bars either side of zero, sorted. Choose it
  over: `bar`, for deltas — direction reads instantly.
- `waterfall` — draws: Steps from a starting total to a final total. Choose
  it over: `bar`, for an ablation — it shows contributions compounding.
- `bar_sig` — draws: Grouped bars with significance brackets and stars.
  Choose it over: `bar`, when the comparison being claimed is pairwise.
- `forest` — draws: Point estimates with confidence intervals and a null
  line. Choose it over: `bar`, when whether an interval crosses zero is the
  question.
- `radar` — draws: A closed polygon per method over 3+ metrics. Choose it
  over: Several bar charts, for a multi-metric profile at a glance.
- `parallel` — draws: One polyline per configuration across independently
  scaled axes. Choose it over: A table, for a hyperparameter sweep — trends
  across axes show up.
- `funnel` — draws: Stage attrition with retention vs. previous and vs.
  intake. Choose it over: `barh`, when the stages are sequential and losses
  compound.
- `stacked_pct` — draws: Composition as percentages; every bar full height.
  Choose it over: Stacked `bar`, when categories have very different totals.
- `treemap` — draws: Nested rectangles with AREA proportional to value.
  Choose it over: `bar`, only when there are too many parts for one axis —
  length beats area for precise reading.
- `upset` — draws: Set intersections as sorted bars over a membership
  matrix. Choose it over: A Venn diagram, past 3 sets — circles cannot stay
  area-true and stop reading as sets.

### Trends and relationships

- `line` — draws: Multi-series lines with optional uncertainty bands. Choose
  it over: The default for anything against time or steps.
- `fan` — draws: A median with nested quantile bands around it. Choose it
  over: `line` with a band, when the spread is skewed or bounded — a
  symmetric ± band on an accuracy near its ceiling implies scores above
  100%.
- `step` — draws: A piecewise-constant series — value holds, then jumps.
  Choose it over: `line`, for schedules — a slope implies values that never
  occurred.
- `scatter` — draws: Points with an optional least-squares fit and R².
  Choose it over: `line`, when x is not ordered and the relationship is the
  point.
- `joint` — draws: Scatter with the marginal distribution of each variable
  beside it. Choose it over: `scatter`, when "and how is each one
  distributed?" is the obvious next question — which for a headline
  correlation it always is.
- `splom` — draws: Every pair of variables as its own scatter, distributions
  down the diagonal. Choose it over: `corr`, when the SHAPE of each
  relationship is the claim — one number cannot tell a straight line from
  two clusters or an outlier.
- `bubble` — draws: Scatter with a third variable as marker AREA, plus a
  size key. Choose it over: `scatter`, when a third quantity matters but not
  enough for its own axis.
- `scaling` — draws: Log-log points with a fitted power law and its
  exponent. Choose it over: `line`, for scaling laws — the exponent is
  computed and annotated.
- `speedup` — draws: Measured speedup against worker count, with the ideal
  line. Choose it over: `line`, for parallel results — the ideal reference
  is what the claim is measured against.
- `pareto` — draws: Scatter with the non-dominated frontier drawn through
  it. Choose it over: `scatter`, for trade-offs where the frontier is the
  finding.
- `area` — draws: Stacked areas — a total and how it divides. Choose it
  over: `line`, when the total matters as much as the parts.
- `residual` — draws: Residuals against fitted values, with the zero line.
  Choose it over: Predicted-vs-actual, where heteroscedasticity hides on the
  diagonal.
- `bland_altman` — draws: Difference between two methods against their mean,
  with limits of agreement. Choose it over: A scatter of A against B, where
  the diagonal reads as agreement and r = 0.99 hides a 10% offset.
- `acf` — draws: Autocorrelation per lag as stems, with the significance
  band. Choose it over: `line`, which shows the level and hides whether each
  point predicts the next.
- `sankey` — draws: Flows between stages at proportional widths. Choose it
  over: `area`, when what matters is what became what.
- `timeline` — draws: Gantt-style spans, one row per task. Choose it over: A
  table of timestamps, when overlap and duration are the point.

### Model evaluation

Give these raw `labels` and `scores` rather than a precomputed curve wherever
you can: the renderer sweeps the threshold itself, so the AUC or AP in the
legend is integrated from the points actually drawn and cannot drift from
the curve beside it.

When only the curve survives — it came from a paper, or from a logged
artefact — pass it directly instead: `fpr`/`tpr` for `roc`, `recall`/
`precision` for `pr`, `probabilities`/`labels` for `calibration`. The
summary statistic is still integrated from the plotted points, so a PR curve
that stops short reports `AP = 0.375 up to recall 0.60` rather than quietly
extrapolating the rest. One evaluation set per figure: `pr`'s baseline and
`calibration`'s bins both move with class balance, so curves from different
test sets cannot share axes honestly.

- `roc` — draws: ROC curves with AUC in the legend, plus the chance
  diagonal. Choose it over: `pr`, when the classes are roughly balanced.
- `pr` — draws: Precision-recall curves with average precision and the
  prevalence baseline. Choose it over: `roc`, when positives are rare — ROC
  flatters a rare-class model.
- `calibration` — draws: Reliability diagram with the ideal diagonal, ECE,
  and per-bin counts. Choose it over: `roc`/`pr`, when whether to TRUST a
  probability is the question.
- `learning_curve` — draws: Score against training-set size, train and
  validation with ±std bands. Choose it over: `line`, to show whether more
  data or a better model is the bottleneck.
- `qq` — draws: Sample quantiles against theoretical normal quantiles, with
  a reference line. Choose it over: `hist`, for judging normality — the eye
  reads a straight line far better than a bell.
- `cd_diagram` — draws: Mean ranks over many datasets, joining methods a
  test cannot separate. Choose it over: `bar_sig`, which compares pairwise
  on ONE dataset — this is the many-datasets headline figure.

### Distributions

- `box` — draws: Median, quartiles, whiskers, outliers per group. Choose it
  over: The compact default for a few groups.
- `violin` — draws: Full mirrored density per group. Choose it over: `box`,
  when a distribution may be multi-modal — a box hides that.
- `strip` — draws: Every raw observation, jittered, with the mean marked.
  Choose it over: `box`, when n is small enough that each point should be
  visible.
- `beeswarm` — draws: Every observation, packed sideways so none hides
  another. Choose it over: `strip`, whose random jitter still overlaps at
  any real n — the eye reads the clumps as density and they are partly
  collision.
- `ridgeline` — draws: Stacked density curves, one row per group. Choose it
  over: `violin`, past ~6 groups, where a violin grid gets too wide.
- `raincloud` — draws: Half violin, box and jittered points together, with
  n. Choose it over: `violin`, when the reader must see the observations —
  twelve seeds look as smooth as twelve thousand.
- `hist` — draws: Binned counts or density. Choose it over: `ecdf`, only
  when the shape of ONE distribution is the point.
- `ecdf` — draws: Empirical cumulative distribution, stepped. Choose it
  over: `hist`, for comparing distributions — no bin width to argue about.
- `survival` — draws: Kaplan-Meier curves with censoring ticks and
  confidence bands. Choose it over: `ecdf`, when some subjects have not
  finished — an ECDF must drop or invent those.
- `hexbin` — draws: Hexagonal density bins with a colourbar. Choose it over:
  `scatter`, past ~2000 points where it becomes a solid blob.
- `hist2d` — draws: A joint distribution as a rectangular binned grid.
  Choose it over: `hexbin`, when the axes are naturally rectangular.

### Matrices and fields

- `heatmap` — draws: Annotated matrix with a colourbar. Choose it over: A
  table, when the pattern matters more than the digits.
- `seqheat` — draws: A per-token quantity drawn on the tokens themselves.
  Choose it over: `heatmap`, for anything measured per token — it puts
  indices on an axis and leaves the reader rebuilding the sentence from a
  legend.
- `corr` — draws: Correlation matrix, diverging map centred at zero. Choose
  it over: `heatmap`, for correlations — sign reads from colour direction.
- `contour` — draws: Filled contours of a 2-D field, levels labelled. Choose
  it over: `heatmap`, for a smooth field like a loss surface.
- `clustermap` — draws: Heatmap with rows and columns reordered into their
  clusters, trees drawn beside. Choose it over: `heatmap`, whenever the row
  order is arbitrary — block structure that is obvious once reordered is
  invisible in the order the log happened to emit.
- `catmap` — draws: A grid whose cells hold a CATEGORY, with a discrete
  legend and no scale. Choose it over: `heatmap`, for any nominal cell —
  expert IDs, pass/fail/timeout, which variant won. A ramp asserts that
  expert 4 is more than expert 1 and that 2 lies between them, and a reader
  takes the ordering as real.
- `quiver` — draws: A field of arrows: where each sample is, and where it
  went. Choose it over: A `scatter` of the before and after positions, which
  carries the same numbers and leaves the reader pairing points up by eye.

### Structure

- `dendrogram` — draws: Hierarchical clustering as a tree, branch heights
  the real merge distances. Choose it over: `corr`, which shows every
  pairwise relationship and no grouping.
- `tree` — draws: A rooted tree from a parent/child structure you already
  have. Choose it over: `dendrogram`, which computes its own linkage from a
  matrix and cannot be given a tree — and `network`, whose force layout
  loses depth.
- `network` — draws: A graph as nodes and links, node area and edge width
  from the data. Choose it over: A concept figure, for anything with REAL
  edges — an image model draws a plausible graph, not yours. Use `sankey`
  for flows between ordered stages and `heatmap` for a dense graph.

### Composites

- `panel` — draws: Any of the above in a lettered grid, `(a)`–`(p)`. Choose
  it over: Several separate figures, when they are read together.

## What ChartMimic has that we do not

Measured, not guessed: `chart_gen.py --audit` maps all 22 ChartMimic
categories onto our 61 types over the 4,800 indexed exemplars. Seventeen
categories are covered. These five are not — every one of them is a figure
shape real papers publish and no generator can produce:

| ChartMimic | n | what to do instead |
|---|---|---|
| Combination | 240 | Hand-write. Bars + a line, usually `twinx`. |
| Hard-to-Recognize | 200 | Hand-write; it is their catch-all. |
| 3D | 160 | `heatmap` or `contour` — a surface hides data. |
| Plot-in-Plot | 160 | Hand-write `ax.inset_axes`; not `panel`. |
| Pie | 160 | `barh`, `stacked_pct` or `treemap`. |

**Combination is the one real gap.** Bars with a line on a second y-axis is
a standard results figure and we have no type for it; the other four are
either deliberate refusals (pie, 3-D — both read worse than what we do
have) or not a chart type at all (Hard-to-Recognize). Adding a
`bar_line`/dual-axis renderer would close the largest measured hole in the
catalogue.

The 17 covered categories are where an exemplar is a REFERENCE rather than
a gap-filler: our generator is still the answer, and the exemplar shows how
a published figure handled the same shape.

### The exemplar store, and rebuilding the index

The raw corpus — code, PNG and PDF per exemplar, ~450 MB — lives in
gitignored `aii_data/chartmimic/`. What is committed is
`scripts/chartmimic_index.json` (1.02 MB, 4,800 entries: id, category,
derived subtype, a one-line intent, up to six matplotlib feature keywords).
Images and code are never tracked — `rule-big-blob-public-only` caps a new
tracked file at 2 MB and the public export excludes data outright.

```bash
python "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/chartmimic_index_build.py" --fetch  # populate the store
python "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/chartmimic_index_build.py"          # rewrite the index
```

`--fetch` pins the dataset revision, which the index records alongside its
count and build date, so a rebuild is checkable. Without the store the
search still works — it just returns our own types only.

## Spec shape

```json
{
  "type": "bar",
  "title": "Accuracy by benchmark",
  "xlabel": "Benchmark",
  "ylabel": "Accuracy (%)",
  "aspect": "16:9",
  "categories": ["ARC", "GSM8K", "HumanEval"],
  "series": [
    {"label": "Baseline", "values": [41.2, 55.8, 33.1], "errors": [1.8, 2.4, 2.9]},
    {"label": "Ours",     "values": [48.9, 67.3, 45.6], "errors": [1.5, 2.0, 2.6]}
  ]
}
```

Keys every type takes: `title`, `aspect` (`"W:H"`), `width_in` (default 7.0
— a full text-width figure), `font_pt`, `font_family`.

Keys that depend on what the type actually draws. Passing one to a type that
never reads it is REFUSED by name — *"nothing read this key"* — rather than
dropped quietly, so a figure never comes back missing what the spec asked
for. "Applies to" below is therefore the set that is accepted, not a hint:

- `xlabel`, `ylabel` — applies to: every type with axes, which is all of
  them but `panel` — a panel has none of its own, so put the labels on the
  sub-specs and a label at panel level is refused. `radar`, `treemap`,
  `sankey`, `parallel` and `upset` do read the key, but draw their own
  geometry with the axis turned off, so the label is accepted and never
  painted.
- `xlim`, `ylim` — applies to: every type — the shared layer applies them
  whatever the geometry, so these two are never refused as unread. Limits
  that would crop data are refused rather than applied.
- `legend_loc` — applies to: only the types that actually draw a legend,
  i.e. two or more named series. A one-series chart gets none, because a
  one-entry legend restates the y-label — and asking to place a legend that
  is not drawn is refused. Takes matplotlib's in-axes placements (`best`,
  `upper right`, `lower left`, …) and NOT `outside …`: that is what the
  layout pass itself uses when it moves a legend off the data, and
  matplotlib accepts it only on a figure legend. You do not need to ask for
  it — the move happens on its own.
- `cmap` — applies to: only the eight types that encode a value as colour —
  `heatmap`, `clustermap`, `corr`, `hist2d`, `hexbin`, `contour`, `quiver`,
  `seqheat`. Anywhere else it is refused: a bar chart given a colour map is
  a spec expecting colour to carry a meaning that chart never encodes. The
  default is already perceptually uniform (`cividis`, or `RdBu_r` where the
  scale has a meaningful zero), so reach for this only with a reason.
  Rainbow and cyclic maps are refused: `jet` puts a bright band in the
  middle of a run that is monotonic in the data, and a reader takes the band
  for a boundary in the result.

`font_family` REPLACES the font, it does not add a fallback. matplotlib uses
the first family it can find and only that one, so the font you name has to
cover everything on the figure — the script AND the Latin labels, digits and
axis numbers around it. Needed only for a script the default cannot draw —
CJK, Devanagari, Thai — and picking a script-only face (e.g. "Noto Sans Thai",
which has no Latin) trades one set of hollow boxes for another. Measured: with
that font the missing-glyph gate refuses again, naming `l`, `p` and the
digits. See *Legibility*.

Per-type keys are documented by `--example <type>`; start from the example
rather than the schema.

### Multi-panel

```json
{"type": "panel", "title": "Overview", "ncols": 2, "panels": [
  {"type": "bar", "categories": ["A", "B"], "series": [{"values": [3, 5]}]},
  {"type": "line", "series": [{"values": [1, 2, 4, 8]}]}
]}
```

Any chart type nests inside `panels`. Sub-panels are lettered `(a)`, `(b)`…
automatically — do not put the letter in the panel's own `title`, which is
how panel labels end up collided with their titles.

`ncols` and `aspect` both default from the panel count: the grid is squared
(capped at three columns, which is the most that fits at the 7-inch text
width) and the canvas is sized so each cell is about 4:3. Pinning `ncols: 4`
is allowed but leaves each cell 1.75 inches wide, which is narrower than a
labelled chart needs — it will be refused rather than drawn on top of
itself.

## How long text may be

Hard caps, checked before anything is drawn, so an over-long string is a
message rather than a figure with its labels cut off. Each was set by
growing that slot until the figure broke, then backing off. Each entry is the
key, its cap, then what happened past it:

- `title`, max **120** — never refused, never collided; it just ate the
  canvas. At 600 characters the chart was 38% of its own figure.
- `xlabel`, `ylabel`, `cbar_label`, max **80** — silently CLIPPED. An x-label
  ran off both edges from ~90 characters, a y-label from ~50, cut mid-word, at
  exit 0.
- `series[].label`, max **60** — legend entries collided at 80 and collapsed
  the layout at 100.
- `categories[]` and any other text, max **80** — under a *vertical* bar the
  limit is 40, with a pointer to `barh`; see *Legibility*.

A title is a heading; an axis label is a quantity and its unit. Detail
belongs in the caption, which has the full column width and as many lines as
it needs.

These are coarse budgets that cannot know the figure's real width — a
3.5-inch column fits about half as much — so the drawn result is measured
too, and anything that still does not fit is refused with the same kind of
message.

## It refuses rather than lying

The generator exits non-zero, writing nothing, when the figure would not
match its data or a reader would not be able to read it. These were live
defects, each of which exited 0 and produced a confident, plausible, wrong
picture:

- **Length mismatches.** Five categories against three values used to render
  three bars and silently drop two categories. Ragged series were zero-filled,
  inventing measurements nobody made.
- **NaN / Infinity / null / strings in values.** matplotlib draws NaN as
  *nothing*, so the gap reads as a measured zero.
- **Right-to-left text.** matplotlib does no bidi reordering and no Arabic
  joining, so Hebrew and Arabic draw left to right in isolated forms —
  reversed and unjoined. Every glyph exists, so the missing-glyph gate above
  sees nothing; the reader who can read the script is the first to know.
- **Glyphs the font cannot draw.** A missing glyph renders as a hollow box
  and matplotlib only warns. It is machine-dependent too: CJK looks right on
  a laptop with a CJK font and ships as boxes from the pipeline image.
- **Labels printed over each other.** Measured on the drawn figure, on the
  ORIENTED box of each label so a tilted tick is judged on its ink rather
  than on the much larger box around it. A 7x7 correlation matrix forced to
  `21:9` rendered its cells as `0.290.360.581.00`.
- **Labels running off the canvas.** A 300-character x-label was drawn with
  30% of itself visible, cut mid-word at both ends, with no warning.
- **A legend sitting on the data it explains.** The legend is opaque by
  design, so whatever is under it is gone rather than faint. A lone chart's
  legend is measured after layout and moved below the axes; a panel cell has
  nowhere to move it and is refused. A `timeline` in a two-column grid drew
  its legend over eight of its nine bars, and the `bar` cell beside it had
  its bar TOPS masked — GSM8K reading as ~40 where the spec said 55.8.
- **Keys nothing reads.** `x_label`/`y_label` instead of `xlabel`/`ylabel` is
  a natural guess; it used to be accepted in silence and the figure came back
  with no axis labels at all — failing the first item on your own checklist,
  visibly only if you look closely. Every key is now checked against what the
  render actually looked up, at every level, so a typo inside a series or a
  panel is caught too, and the message suggests the real spelling.
- **A series drawn without a name while its neighbours have one.** The
  legend names only the series that carry a `label`, so the rest are drawn
  and left unidentified — three series with two labelled shows blue, amber
  and green bars and names two colours. Nothing about the picture looks
  wrong, which is what makes it worth refusing. Naming none of them is fine:
  that is a chart with one meaning, and the y-label carries it.
- **A stated limit that crops the data.** `xlim`/`ylim` outside the values,
  `vmin`/`vmax` outside the matrix, or an explicit `levels` list narrower than
  `z`. Each one hides part of the finding while the axis or colourbar states a
  range the data does not have: `vmax: 0.3` on a matrix running 0.10..0.95
  painted 0.30 and 0.95 the identical yellow under a bar labelled
  0.100..0.300, and `levels: [2.6..3.2]` over a field of 2.3..4.6 left 70% of
  the plot area as bare page — the basin holding the optimum included, drawn
  exactly like no-data. Cropping is a legitimate wish; it just has to be a
  stated one, so widen the limit or drop it and let the axis fit.
- **Non-positive values on a log axis.** matplotlib MASKS them rather than
  complaining, so the figure comes back with fewer points than the data. Five
  points drawn trending up carried a fit annotation reading `y = -1.75x +
  53.2`, because the slope was still computed over the two at `x = 0` that the
  reader cannot see. Applies wherever `logx`/`logy` does — `line`, `scaling`,
  `scatter`, `pareto`.
- **A negative band in a stacked chart.** Bands and segments are drawn end to
  end, so a negative one folds back over the one beneath it and every height
  stops matching its value: 10 / -8 / 5 drew as three bands of 10 / 8 / 5,
  with a top edge of 10 where the total is 7. Use `line` with one line per
  part for signed quantities. Same for stacked `bar` and `stacked_pct`.
- **Tied scores in a `bump` chart.** It has one row per rank, so a tie can
  only be broken by the order the series happen to appear in — two models
  level at 80.0 drew as a permanent one-rank gap, and moving them past each
  other in the spec, numbers unchanged, showed a crossing that is not in the
  data. Crossings are what this chart type is read for. Use `line`, or
  `slope` for two periods, which draw the scores themselves.
- **Two series a reader cannot tell apart.** The palette holds eight colours
  and wraps; the dash pattern is a second channel and multiplies that to 32
  for line charts, but a solid shape has no dash. A twelve-series `bar`
  shipped four PAIRS of identical swatches and a fifty-series `line` wrapped
  both channels at series 32. Measured on the drawn legend, so it holds for
  bars, lines and markers alike — and `bubble`'s size key, whose entries
  share a colour on purpose, is judged on size as well and passes.

Errors name the offending key and index (`series[1].values has 2 entries but
5 were expected`), so a bad spec is one edit from correct. Nothing partial is
ever written — a half-file would pass the downstream existence check.

## Legibility

- **Non-Latin scripts.** The default font covers Latin, Greek and Cyrillic —
  all three verified, not assumed. Hebrew and Arabic are refused even though
  the glyphs are there: matplotlib does no bidi reordering and no Arabic
  joining, so it draws the characters left to right in isolated forms and the
  label comes out reversed and unjoined, with every glyph present and nothing
  else noticing. Transliterate, or write the label in the paper's own script.
  For any other script set
  `font_family` (e.g. `"Noto Sans CJK JP"`) — matplotlib uses the *first*
  resolvable family and does no per-glyph fallback, so the covering font has
  to go first. Without it the figure is refused rather than shipped full of
  boxes.

  **`font_family` only helps where that font is installed, and the pipeline
  image has none.** It ships 23 families, not one of which covers CJK, Indic
  or Thai — so inside the image the escape hatch resolves to nothing and the
  figure is refused either way. The refusal now names the FONT rather than
  the script: a name that does not resolve is caught before anything is
  drawn, with the closest installed families listed, because matplotlib
  otherwise falls back in silence and the glyph gate then blames the text.
  Label it in Latin script, or add the font to
  `Dockerfile.pipeline` (Noto Sans CJK is ~20 MB). On a developer machine
  with the font present it works: verified rendering a Japanese title and
  Japanese category labels with no missing glyph.
- **Dense categories.** Labels wrap when long, tilt at 30° when that isn't
  enough, and stand up at 90° when even that collides — where neighbours
  cannot touch however long they get. Which of the three applies is decided
  by MEASURING the drawn labels against the axes after layout, so a panel
  cell gets the treatment its own width needs rather than the one the whole
  figure's width would suggest. Names past ~40 characters do not fit under a
  vertical bar at all and are refused with a pointer to `barh`, which puts
  the label on the y-axis where the full width is available.
- **Column-width figures.** `width_in: 3.5` works for the ordinary types —
  bar, barh, line, scatter, box, hist, ecdf, heatmap — provided the spec is
  written for that size: about four categories, two or three series, and a
  title under ~45 characters. These of the catalogue's own examples are
  refused at 3.5 inches, because each is written for the full text width —
  the list is pinned by a test that measures it, so it cannot go stale:

  > `bar_sig`, `bland_altman`, `bubble`, `bump`, `catmap`, `cd_diagram`,
  > `clustermap`, `contour`, `corr`, `dendrogram`, `dumbbell`, `fan`,
  > `funnel`, `panel`, `parallel`, `radar`, `sankey`, `seqheat`, `slope`,
  > `speedup`, `survival`, `timeline`, `treemap`, `upset`, `volcano`

  A leaner spec fits for every one of them — measured, including the
  label-dense ones (`corr`, `upset`, `sankey`, `treemap`, `parallel`,
  `radar`, `cd_diagram`), which only refuse above a lower ceiling than the
  ordinary types. Three one-letter categories draw at 3.5 inches; `upset`
  is the tightest, taking two sets before its own "Intersection size" axis
  label runs off the edge. What the list above says is that the SHIPPED
  EXAMPLES do not fit, because each is written for the full text width.
  Every refusal names what is in the way, and `upset` and `cd_diagram`
  quantify it ("the method names need 4.2 inches of margin") rather than
  shipping something unreadable.
- **Many series.** Past eight the palette wraps, so the line style becomes a
  second channel — otherwise series 1 and 9 were the same colour. Past six,
  the legend moves below the axes. Inside, it
  covered the data at twelve series and hid a tick label; outside, layout
  reserves real space for it.
- **Long titles** are measured after layout and wrapped. On a chart whose
  axes is a narrow strip (a `barh` with long names) the title is promoted to
  a figure heading, since an axes title would centre on the strip and run
  off the page.
- **`$` is safe.** A matched pair used to be read as mathtext, so
  "Cost $5 to $9" rendered as "Cost 5to9". All user text is now escaped, so
  dollars print verbatim. The trade: mathtext is unavailable — write
  superscripts in Unicode (`R²`, `10⁻³`), which the fits already do.

## What the house style already handles

Do not re-solve these; they are set globally in `chart_style.py`.

- **Colourblind-safe palette** (seaborn's `colorblind` set). Never override
  it with a red/green pair. The separations are measured, not assumed: the
  closest pair is ΔE*ab 14.0 under protanopia and 10.3 under deuteranopia,
  against a just-noticeable difference of ~1. **Greyscale print separates
  the first three series and no more** — past that the lightnesses cluster,
  and violet against grey is ΔL* 0.3, the same shade in print. If the paper
  will be read in B&W, keep it to three series or give the extras a second
  channel of your own.
- **Sans-serif**, sized for the figure's final print size.
- **No chartjunk** — no 3D, gradients, shadows, coloured plot background;
  faint horizontal grid behind the data only.
- **Constrained layout**, so an axis label can never be clipped off the
  canvas. This was the single most common defect across every library
  surveyed, including in otherwise flawless output. Layout alone does not
  cover TITLES — it reflows axes but cannot wrap a line — so titles wider
  than their axes are measured after layout and wrapped.
- **TrueType (Type 42) fonts, never Type 3.** matplotlib emits Type 3 by
  default and **IEEE and ACM submission systems reject PDFs containing
  it**, so every default matplotlib figure is non-compliant.
- **Legend headroom** — the y-range is widened before an inside legend is
  placed, because `loc="best"` lands on the data when nothing is free. Where
  headroom cannot help — a horizontal chart, whose free space is on the
  x-axis, or a plot area that is full by construction — the placed legend is
  MEASURED against the drawn bars and moved below the axes if it covers any.
- **Very dense point clouds are drawn as a bitmap inside the vector file.**
  A scatter writes every marker as its own path — 360,000 points is a 5.7 MB
  PDF, and six of those do not fit a venue's upload limit. Past ~25,000
  points in one series the cloud alone is rasterized; the axes, ticks,
  labels and legend stay vector, so the text is still selectable and sharp
  at any zoom. Below that threshold the bitmap would be the *larger* of the
  two, so nothing changes.
- **Cell annotations are outlined against their own fill.** A heatmap's
  numbers take near-black or near-white, whichever contrasts better with the
  cell — and over a continuous colour map the better one is not always
  enough: cividis bottoms out at 4.18:1 and RdBu_r at 4.19:1, against the
  4.5:1 the rest of the style holds itself to, in exactly the mid-range cells
  that make up most of a matrix. A hairline in the opposite ink fixes that
  without touching the map, which is the part that cannot change.
- **Sub-decade log axes keep their tick labels.** A log axis spanning less
  than one decade — a loss curve from 2.90 to 2.05, say — contains no power
  of ten. matplotlib ticks only at powers of ten, so it places 10⁰ and 10¹,
  *both outside the view*, and the visible axis carries no label at all.
  Silently. Handled.

## Verify what you generated

Read the PNG back and look at it. The generator prevents the structural
defects above, but it cannot know that your data was wrong. Check:

- every number in the figure matches the number you meant to plot;
- axis labels state units;
- the caption describes what is actually drawn;
- the chart type still says what you meant once you can see it.

Two things that used to be on this list are now refused instead, so a figure
you can read back cannot have them: overlapping category labels, and a
series drawn without a name while its neighbours have one.

If a figure is crowded, widen `aspect` (`"21:9"`) or split it into a
`panel` — do not shrink the font.

## Limits

- **Hand-drawn architecture diagrams** (a pipeline, a block diagram, a
  flowchart with prose in the boxes) are out of scope: they have no
  underlying numbers and a layout engine has nothing to compute from. Those
  go to `aii-concept-fig-gen`. A graph whose edges ARE data — citations,
  message counts, co-occurrence — is a `network` here, because the picture
  has to match the edge list.
- **No LaTeX-native output.** PGFPlots produces the best camera-ready
  result of anything surveyed, because the figure text is typeset by the
  paper's own engine in the paper's own font. What is missing is a second
  backend behind 60 renderers, not the toolchain: `texlive-pictures` is
  pulled in as a dependency of `texlive-latex-extra`, and a pgfplots document
  compiles at exit 0 wherever that toolchain is present. (This entry used to
  say the package was absent and would cost +81 MB. Measured in the built
  image, both halves were wrong.) **Where it is present changed on
  2026-09-07**: TeX Live left the `aii_pipeline` runtime image for
  `amgrobelnik/aii_tex`, which `aii_pipeline.bundles.ensure_tex()` fetches at
  `gen_full_paper`. Figure generation runs in the invention loop, HOURS
  before that, so a pgfplots backend here could not assume `pdflatex` is on
  PATH — it would have to await the bundle first. One more reason the missing
  piece is a backend, not a package.
- **The legibility gate reads TEXT.** It refuses a label printed over another
  label or cut off by the canvas. A label printed over the DATA is only
  handled where a renderer registers it with `place_point_label`, which five
  types do: `pareto`, `network`, `tree`, `volcano` and `bubble`. If you
  hand-write a figure, call `fit_point_labels` too.
  `bubble` registers only the names it draws OUTSIDE their disc — a name
  small enough to sit inside its own bubble is already where it belongs and
  no nudge improves it. That registration became worth doing once the
  clearance test started measuring each marker against ITS OWN radius: with
  a single radius for the axes (the largest drawn) a bubble field running
  4 px to 88 px left no candidate position measuring clean, so every name
  stayed on its first guess.
  One limit remains, and it is the candidate SET rather than the model: the
  nudger tries corners a few pixels out, which cannot clear a very large
  neighbouring disc. On a crowded bubble chart a small bubble's name can
  still touch a big one — give those names in a legend, or space the points.
- Still uncovered: geographic/choropleth (needs a basemap and boundary data,
  neither of which is in the image). Add a renderer to its family's
  `chart_renderers*.py` rather than hand-writing matplotlib at the call site
  — that is what keeps every figure in a paper looking like a set.

- Validating JSON (schema validation against experiment schemas)
- Formatting JSON (generate full/mini/preview versions)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --format {1} --file {2}' ::: 'exp_sel_data_out' 'exp_gen_sol_out' 'exp_eval_sol_out' :::+ '/tmp/full_data_out.json' '/tmp/method_out.json' '/tmp/eval_out.json'
```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

Schemas are stored in `.claude/skills/aii-json/schemas/`:

**Experiment Pipeline** — the four formats `schemas/` actually holds and
`AVAILABLE_FORMATS` in `scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py` accepts (this
list used to name six hypothesis-selection schemas that exist nowhere and
omit the proof one; corrected 2026-09-03):
- `exp_sel_data_out.json` - Experiment Data Selection format
- `exp_gen_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Generation format
- `exp_eval_sol_out.json` - Experiment Solution Evaluation format
- `exp_proof_out.json` - Experiment Proof format

---

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

name: aii-web-tools
description: "Runs web search, page fetch as markdown, and regex grep over full HTML or PDF text via this skill's own scripts (aii_fast_web_search.py, aii_fast_web_fetch.py) — a free-first keyless search stack with Serper fallback that works even where built-in WebSearch and WebFetch are absent. Use when a query, page, or paper must be searched, read, or mined for an exact quote, number, table value, or methodology sentence, and whenever a lossy summary would lose the detail. Triggers: web search, scholarly search, OpenAlex, Crossref, Serper, fetch a URL as markdown, read a PDF, arXiv, regex grep a page, exact quote, table value, citation check. NOT for: planning a broad multi-source literature review or mass verification campaign — use aii-web-research-tools; NOT for a PDF file already on disk — extraction, form filling, merging and PDF creation are anthropic-pdf; NOT for driving a browser or testing a UI."

## Web tools

You have three web capabilities: **search**, **fetch**, and **grep** (exact
regex extraction over a full page or PDF).

**Pick where they come from, in this order:**

1. **If you have built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` tools, PREFER those over the
   scripts below.** They may be **deferred tools** (listed by name but with
   schemas not yet loaded) — if so, call `ToolSearch("select:WebSearch,WebFetch")`
   ONCE to load them, then use them normally. Do not skip them just because they
   need that one extra load step; they are the preferred path. Pair them with the
   `aii_web_tools__fetch_grep` script below when you need exact text / numbers /
   methodology that a summary would miss, or when reading a PDF.
2. **Only if you have NO built-in `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`** (e.g. the OpenHands
   backend), use the scripts in this skill (below). They are our own
   implementations — free-first web search (keyless general/scholarly engines,
   Serper fallback), html2text + PyMuPDF for fetch, and regex grep over the full
   document text. They work without any built-in web tools.

Workflow either way: **search** (discover) → **fetch** (read for the gist) →
**grep** (pull exact details / read PDFs).

---

## Running the scripts

Run every script with the skill's pre-provisioned interpreter (it already has
`requests`, `html2text`, `pymupdf`, `python-dotenv`). Set `PY` once:

```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-web-tools"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

### 1. Search the web (free-first: general or scholarly)

```bash
# general web (default): keyless engines (ddgs, marginalia); Serper only if they miss
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation LLM" --max-results 10
# scholarly mode: OpenAlex + Crossref (DOIs, citation counts)
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_search.py" --query "neuro-symbolic FOL translation" --mode scholarly
```

Returns ranked title / URL / snippet lines. `--mode general` (default) uses
keyless general engines; `--mode scholarly` uses academic APIs. Both fall back
to Serper (paid) only when the free engines miss. Use search first to scan the
landscape; snippets are for discovery only — fetch a page before judging it.

### 2. Fetch a page as markdown (HTML or PDF)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" fetch --url "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11366" --max-chars 10000
```

`--max-chars` caps output (default 10000); `--char-offset N` pages further in.
Handles PDFs transparently via PyMuPDF.

### 3. Grep a page or PDF (exact regex extraction)

```bash
$PY "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_fast_web_fetch.py" grep --url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366" --pattern "verbal reinforcement" --max-matches 20 --context-chars 200
```

Returns only the matching sections with surrounding context — the right tool
for exact numbers, table values, methodology, or long PDFs where a summary
would lose the detail. `-i` for case-insensitive.

**Parallelize** independent searches/fetches in one turn; only sequence a
fetch after the search that produced its URL.

---

## Notes

- The scripts call our ability server. If a script prints
  `Ability service not available`, the server is down — say so rather than
  silently improvising a different search method.
- Do **not** hand-roll your own `requests`/scraping for search when these
  tools are available: Serper returns clean Google results and the fetch/grep
  scripts already handle HTML, PDFs, and encoding.
