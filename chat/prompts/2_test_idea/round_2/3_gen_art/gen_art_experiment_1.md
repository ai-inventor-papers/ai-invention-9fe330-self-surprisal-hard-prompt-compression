title: SSHPC vs Proxy-Model Compression Benchmark
summary: >-
  Implement Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (target LLM's own next-token logits) and compare against LLMLingua, SelectiveContext,
  Random, and Proxy-on-target baselines on Llama-3-8B and Qwen2-7B across GSM8K, HotpotQA, LongBench, and NaturalQuestions
  at 2x-10x compression, measuring EM/F1/ROUGE and prefill-vs-generation latency.

  === PIPELINE OVERVIEW ===

  1. DATASET LOADING (scripts/01_load_data.py)
     - Load GSM8K, HotpotQA, NaturalQuestions, LongBench subsets from HuggingFace
     - Subset to ~500 prompts per dataset for time budget
     - Create 'prompt' strings and ground-truth answer fields

  2. SURPRISAL COMPUTATION (core/sshpc.py)
     - SurprisalAnalyzer class: single forward pass through target LM yields all position logits
     - compute_surprisal(text) -> [-log P(token_i | context up to i-1)] for each token
     - Special token handling: assign INF surprisal to BOS, EOS, system/instruction tokens
     - Query-conditioning variant: compute P(token | context + last_user_message) via cross-attention mask

  3. SSHPC COMPRESSION (core/sshpc.py)
     - compute_token_importance(prompt, query=None) -> ranked token list by surprisal
     - prune_lowest_surprisal(tokens, target_ratio) -> compressed prompt
     - iterative_rescore(prompt, target_ratio, rounds=3): recompute surprisal after each pruning round (for >=8x)
     - keep_special_tokens() preserves instruction/query tokens permanently

  4. BASELINE METHODS (core/baselines.py)
     - LLMLingua: GPT-2 as proxy model, iterative minimum-entropy scoring (from official code)
     - SelectiveContext: GPT-2 self-information scoring
     - Random pruning: random token removal at same ratio
     - No compression: original prompt
     - Proxy-on-target ablation: LLMLingua algorithm but with target LLM as proxy (single-pass, no iterative conditioning)

  5. TASK EVALUATION (evaluation/evaluators.py)
     - GSM8K: generate answers, execute Python code, pass@1 accuracy
     - HotpotQA: generate answers, compute EM/F1
     - LongBench QA subset: EM/F1
     - NaturalQuestions: EM@1, F1@1

  6. LATENCY MEASUREMENT (core/latency.py)
     - Prefill time: time for model to process compressed prompt (first token generation)
     - Generation time: time per generated token after prefill
     - Break-even ratio: compression_ratio where prefill_savings = generation_overhead

  7. EXPERIMENT ORCHESTRATOR (run_experiment.py)
     For each model in [Llama-3-8B, Qwen2-7B]:
       For each dataset in [GSM8K, HotpotQA, LongBench_QA, NQ]:
         For each method in [SSHPC, SSHPC_iterative, LLMLingua, SelectiveContext, Random, ProxyOnTarget, None]:
           For each ratio in [2x, 4x, 8x, 10x]:
             - Load ~500 prompts
             - Compute compressed prompts
             - Run task generation
             - Compute metrics + latency
             - Save results to method_out.json

  === KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ===

  Surprisal computation (single forward pass):
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='pt')
    with torch.no_grad():
      logits = model(**inputs).logits  # [1, seq_len, vocab]
    shift_logits = logits[:, :-1, :]
    shift_targets = inputs['input_ids'][:, 1:]
    log_probs = F.log_softmax(shift_logits, dim=-1)
    log_pt = gather(log_probs, shift_targets)  # log P(true token)
    surprisals = -log_pt

  Special token protection:
    special_ids = set(tokenizer.all_special_ids) + instruction_token_ids
    surprisals[special_positions] = float('inf')

  Query-conditioning:
    For QA tasks: condition P(token | context + query) where query = last user message
    Implementation: prepend query to context, compute surprisal for context tokens only (positions after query length)

  Iterative re-scoring (for >=8x):
    for round in 3:
      compute surprisals on current compressed prompt
      prune lowest-surprisal tokens to reach next compression milestone
      re-tokenize and recompute

  Output format (method_out.json):
  {
    "experiments": [
      {
        "model": "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B",

    "summary": {
      "best_method_per_dataset": ...,
      "proxy_mismatch_effect": ...
    }
  }
fallback_plan: >-
  If target LLM inference is too slow or OOMs on A100: (1) Reduce model to Qwen2-7B only, drop Llama-3-8B; (2) Reduce prompt
  subset to 200 per dataset; (3) Use float8 quantization (bitsandbytes) to fit models; (4) Use smaller context windows (truncate
  prompts to 4K tokens). If proxy-model methods (LLMLingua) fail due to GPT-2 loading issues: implement from scratch using
  GPT-2 nano (124M params) with minimum-entropy scoring as described in the original paper. If task evaluation via code execution
  fails for GSM8K: use regex extraction of final number as fallback. If latency measurement is unreliable due to CUDA caching:
  use warmup + median of 10 runs per prompt.
testing_plan: >-
  PHASE 1 (30 min): Verify surprisal computation correctness by comparing computed perplexity against lm-evaluation-harness
  on a 10-prompt subset for both models. PHASE 2 (30 min): Test compression pipeline end-to-end on 5 prompts per dataset —
  verify special tokens preserved, compression ratios match targets, iterative re-scoring produces correct ratios. PHASE 3
  (1 hour): Run full evaluation on 50 prompts per dataset per method to catch bugs. PHASE 4 (4 hours): Full run with 500 prompts
  per dataset. Confirmation signals: (a) perplexity matches expected values within 0.01, (b) compression ratio exactly matches
  target (within 1%), (c) special tokens never pruned, (d) latency measurements are stable across repeated runs. Kill-switch:
  if any method crashes or produces NaN metrics, skip that method and log the error.

<software_constraints>
- Python only implementation
- Python standard library and all popular PyPI packages available (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, requests, etc.)
- Local parallelism encouraged: multiprocessing, asyncio, threading — see aii-parallel-computing skill
- LLM API calls must go through OpenRouter only (no direct OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **SPEND BUDGET**: at most $10 USD of OpenRouter API calls for this artifact. Nothing outside your own code enforces this — the key you are given has no per-artifact cap — so it holds only if you track cumulative cost after every call and stop when you approach it. Budget the work up front: estimate the per-call cost and the number of calls BEFORE starting a sweep, not after it overruns. Exceeding it spends real money that the run cannot recover.

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.

name: aii-python
description: "Applies this repo's Python conventions to experiment and evaluation scripts: uv-only environment setup (never pip), loguru logging with stdout plus a rotating file sink, @logger.catch(reraise=True) with explicit exception types, pathlib file access, type hints, and a standard main() script skeleton. ALWAYS read before writing or editing any Python script that runs an experiment, evaluation, or data-processing job. Triggers: writing or refactoring a Python script, uv venv, uv pip install, pyproject dependencies, loguru, logging setup, try/except and error handling, pathlib, script structure, Python 3.12. NOT for: parallelism, GPU throughput or hardware sizing (use aii-parallel-computing and aii-use-hardware), scaling long autonomous jobs (use aii-long-running-tasks), splitting oversized output files (use aii-file-size-limit), calling LLMs (use aii-openrouter-llms), or notebooks meant for Colab (use aii-colab)."
---

## Environment Setup

- Python 3.12+
- **NEVER use `pip` or `.venv/bin/pip`** — they are not installed. Use `uv` for ALL package operations:
  ```bash
  uv venv .venv --python=3.12
  source .venv/bin/activate  # or: .venv/bin/python script.py
  uv pip install pandas loguru  # NOT: pip install
  ```
- Create `.toml` file with dependencies, create uv `.venv` and activate it
- NO inline dependencies (no `# /// script` headers)

## Logging

Use `loguru` for all logging. Add a file sink alongside stdout.

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove()  # Remove default handler
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")
```

Rules:
- Log every major step (data loading, processing start/end, results)
- If applicable, log every LLM API call input and output
- Truncate long outputs in logs (add truncation logic for potentially large strings)
- Use `logger.error()` in except blocks (traceback auto-captured)

## Error Handling

- Wrap major operations in try/except blocks
- Use `@logger.catch(reraise=True)` decorator on main functions — without `reraise=True`, the script exits 0 even on uncaught exceptions, hiding failures from downstream consumers
- Use explicit exception types, not bare `except:`
- Never silently swallow exceptions — always log them

```python
@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    try:
        data = load_data(path)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error("Data file not found")
        raise
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logger.error("Invalid JSON in data file")
        raise
```

## Code Structure

- Use `pathlib.Path` for file operations: `Path("data/input.json").read_text()` not `open(...).read()`
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Use keyword arguments for functions with more than 4 parameters
- No hardcoded paths — derive from script location or accept as arguments

## Script Pattern

Standard pattern for experiment/evaluation scripts:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Brief description of what this script does."""

from loguru import logger
from pathlib import Path
import json
import sys

logger.remove()
logger.add(sys.stdout, level="INFO", format="{time:HH:mm:ss}|{level:<7}|{message}")
logger.add("logs/run.log", rotation="30 MB", level="DEBUG")

@logger.catch(reraise=True)
def main():
    # Load data
    data_path = Path("full_data_out.json")
    logger.info(f"Loading data from {data_path}")
    data = json.loads(data_path.read_text())
    logger.info(f"Loaded {len(data['examples'])} examples")

    # Process
    results = []
    for i, example in enumerate(data["examples"]):
        try:
            result = process(example)
            results.append(result)
        except Exception:
            logger.error(f"Failed on example {i}")
            continue

    # Save output
    output = {"examples": results}
    Path("method_out.json").write_text(json.dumps(output, indent=2))
    logger.info(f"Saved {len(results)} results")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

name: aii-long-running-tasks
description: "Scales an experiment or evaluation up in stages — mini, 10, 50, 100, 200, then the largest run that fits — recording runtime at each step and extrapolating time-per-example against the remaining time budget before growing further, with background execution and hard RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_CPU caps. ALWAYS read before launching any script expected to run for many minutes or hours over a dataset. Triggers: long-running job, overnight or unattended run, time budget, how many examples fit, extrapolate runtime, start small then scale up, run in background and poll, avoid a timeout, full-dataset evaluation, resource limits. NOT for choosing the concurrency mechanism itself (aii-parallel-computing), measuring the machine's CPU, RAM or GPU (aii-use-hardware), or provisioning cloud pods (aii-runpod)."
---

## Core Principles

1. **Time budget first**: Read your time/runtime constraints before running anything. Set every Bash timeout to fit within the budget.
2. **Start small, scale up**: Run on minimal input first, fix errors, then increase scale.
3. **Extrapolate before scaling**: Use recorded runtimes to predict whether the next step fits in the budget. Don't guess — calculate.
4. **Background execution**: For anything that takes >1 min, run in background (`run_in_background=true`) and do useful work while waiting.
5. **Stop early if needed**: Quality results on less data beats a timeout or crash. It's always acceptable to stop at a smaller scale.

---

## Gradual Scaling Sequence

Run code at increasing data sizes, checking runtime at each step.

Substitute your actual file names:
- `{mini_file}` — mini JSON (3 examples) from dependency workspace
- `{full_file}` — full dataset from dependency workspace
- `{script}` — your processing script (e.g., `./method.py`, `./eval.py`)
- `{schema}` — JSON schema to validate output against

**STEP 1 — MINI DATA:** Run `{script}` on `{mini_file}`. Do NOT truncate logs. Fix all errors. Validate output against `{schema}`. Verify you are NOT using mock scripts, mock data, or mock APIs.

**STEP 2 — 10 EXAMPLES:** Modify `{script}` to load only the first 10 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Validate schema. Record the runtime.

**STEP 3 — 50 EXAMPLES:** Load first 50 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. **EXTRAPOLATE**: Using runtimes from steps 2-3, estimate time per example. Calculate how many examples fit in your remaining time budget. If 50 already used most of the budget, stop here.

**STEP 4 — 100 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 100 examples. Run and fix errors. Record runtime. Re-extrapolate with the new data point.

**STEP 5 — 200 EXAMPLES (if budget allows):** Load first 200 examples from `{full_file}`. Run and fix errors. Record runtime.

**STEP 6 — MAXIMIZE:** Using all recorded runtimes, extrapolate time-per-example (it may not be perfectly linear — account for overhead). Calculate the maximum number of examples that fits within your remaining time budget with a 10% safety margin. Load that many (or all if they fit). Run and validate.

## Final Testing Phase

After completing the scaling sequence, redo the entire sequence **one more time** up to your final example count:

mini → 10 → 50 → 100 → 200 → max

At each scale: look for issues, fix problems, validate output, ensure it completes within time limits.

---

## Background Execution

For any step that takes >1 min, run as a **background task**:

1. Launch with Bash `run_in_background=true`
2. While it runs, use the time productively:
   - Sanity-check previous outputs
   - Verify file integrity (correct field names, non-empty values)
   - Review code for edge cases at larger scale
   - Prepare the next step
3. Check back on the background task to get results
4. If it failed, fix errors and re-run

---

## Resource Limits

Set hard RAM and CPU time limits so code fails fast instead of crashing the system. Read limits from `<hardware>` and leave headroom for the OS (e.g., if 16GB total, cap at 14GB).

Python example using stdlib `resource` module:
```python
import resource
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (14 * 1024**3, 14 * 1024**3))  # 14GB RAM
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_CPU, (3600, 3600))  # 1 hour CPU time
```
Exceeding RAM raises `MemoryError`. Exceeding CPU time sends `SIGKILL`.

## Monitoring

At each step, record runtime AND check resource usage (`free -h` for RAM, `top -bn1 | head -5` for CPU). If memory usage is climbing toward the limit or CPU is pegged, stop and investigate before scaling further.

## Contents

- Validating JSON (schema validation against experiment schemas)
- Formatting JSON (generate full/mini/preview versions)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Validating JSON

Validate JSON files against predefined schemas for experiment-based hypothesis selection, data collection, solution generation, and evaluation.

### Quick Start

1. Read the schema spec you need to adhere to (e.g., `schemas/exp_eval_sol_out.json`)
2. Create your output file following that schema structure
3. Validate:

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /path/to/eval_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_validate_schema.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py --format exp_eval_sol_out --file /tmp/eval_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple validations):**

IMPORTANT: When validating multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_validate_schema.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --format {1} --file {2}' ::: 'exp_sel_data_out' 'exp_gen_sol_out' 'exp_eval_sol_out' :::+ '/tmp/full_data_out.json' '/tmp/method_out.json' '/tmp/eval_out.json'
```

**Example output (success):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_eval_sol_out

✓ Validation PASSED
```

**Example output (failure):**
```
Validating: aii_json_validate_schema.py
Format: exp_sel_data_out

✗ Validation FAILED

Errors:
  Path: datasets → 0 → examples → 0
  Error: 'output' is a required property
  Validator: required
```

**Parameters:**

`--format` (required)
- Format type to validate against
- Determines which schema to use

`--file` (required)
- Path to JSON file to validate
- Must be valid JSON
- **Always pass an absolute path.** Relative paths resolve from the
  ability server's CWD (typically ``/ai-inventor/aii_server``), not from
  your agent workspace, so ``data_out/x.json`` will silently look in the
  wrong directory and fail with "Could not load JSON file". The validate
  endpoint also accepts a ``workspace_dir`` arg if you need to keep a
  relative path — pass your workspace path there.

**Tips:**
- Fix errors in your JSON and rerun validation until it passes

### Schema Files

## Formatting JSON

Generate three size-optimized versions of a JSON file for efficient development and preview:
- **full**: Identical to original (all data)
- **mini**: First 3 items only (for quick testing)
- **preview**: Mini + all strings truncated to 200 chars (for quick inspection)

### Quick Start

```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

### Script: aii_json_format_mini_preview.py

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py --input method_out.json
```

**Parallel execution (multiple files):**

IMPORTANT: When formatting multiple files, use GNU parallel instead of separate Bash tool calls:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-json" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_json_format_mini_preview.py" && \
parallel -j 50 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --input {}' ::: 'full_data_out.json' 'method_out.json' 'eval_out.json'
```

**Example output:**
```
Generated 3 versions:
  Full (50 items): /path/to/full_method_out.json
  Mini (3 items): /path/to/mini_method_out.json
  Preview (3 items, truncated): /path/to/preview_method_out.json
```

**Parameters:**

`--input` (required)
- Path to input JSON file
- Must have a top-level array
- Example: `method_out.json`, `full_data_out.json`

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory for generated files
- Default: same directory as input file
- Files are prefixed with `full_`, `mini_`, `preview_`

**Output Files:**

All three files use the same base name with different prefixes:
- `full_{basename}.json` - Complete dataset (identical to original)
- `mini_{basename}.json` - First 3 array items only
- `preview_{basename}.json` - First 3 items with strings truncated to 200 chars

**Tips:**
- Input JSON must have a top-level array structure
- String truncation is recursive (applies to nested objects and arrays)
- Use preview files for quick inspection without reading large datasets
- Use mini files for developing/testing code before running on full dataset

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```

name: aii-file-size-limit
description: "Splits an oversized generated output file into numbered parts that each fit a size limit: checks sizes with ls -lh, writes full_data_out_1.json, full_data_out_2.json and so on into a matching directory, deletes the original, repoints the reading code at a sorted glob, and regenerates mini and preview variants per part. ALWAYS run right after a script writes JSON output, and whenever a file is too big to keep, exceeds a stated file size limit, or gets rejected for its size. Triggers: file too large, output exceeds the size limit, oversized or huge JSON, ls -lh size check after generating results, splitting or chunking an output file into parts, output directory instead of one file. NOT for: schema validation or making mini and preview variants of a file already within the limit (use aii-json), or general Python script conventions (use aii-python)."
---

## File Size Check

After generating output files, run `ls -lh` to check sizes. If ANY file exceeds the provided file size limit:

1. Create directory with same base name (e.g., `full_data_out/` for `full_data_out.json`)
2. Split into parts under the limit named: `full_data_out_1.json`, `full_data_out_2.json`, etc.
3. Place parts in directory (e.g., `full_data_out/full_data_out_1.json`, `full_data_out/full_data_out_2.json`)
4. Delete the original oversized file
5. Update the script to read from split files: `for f in sorted(glob.glob('full_data_out/full_data_out_*.json')): data.extend(json.load(open(f)))`
6. For each split part, generate its own mini/preview versions with the json skill's format script

name: aii-use-hardware
description: "Detects the CPU, RAM, GPU and VRAM actually available — cgroup v1 and v2 container quotas and CPU affinity rather than misleading host values — then sets RAM and VRAM budgets via resource.setrlimit and torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction so a script raises a catchable error instead of being OOM-killed, and picks the right torch wheel for the detected device. ALWAYS read before loading a large dataset, installing torch, or sizing batches and worker counts. Triggers: how much RAM or CPU or GPU is available, container memory limit, cgroup, OOM killed, MemoryError, os.cpu_count reports host cores, nproc, VRAM, CUDA available, CPU-only torch build, dataset too big for memory, chunking. NOT for spreading work across that hardware once measured (aii-parallel-computing), staged scale-up runs against a time budget (aii-long-running-tasks), or renting cloud machines (aii-runpod)."
---

**Step 1** — Run `bash scripts/get_hardware.sh` (relative to this skill's directory).

Read the `=== CGROUP ===` section carefully. If `Type: cgroup v1` or `cgroup v2`:
- You are in a **container with hard resource limits**. Exceeding them = OOM kill, no recovery.
- **Never** use `psutil.virtual_memory().total`, `free -h`, `/proc/meminfo`, `os.cpu_count()`, or `nproc` for resource limits — these report **host** values, not your container's allocation.
- **Always** read limits from the cgroup paths shown in the output, or use the Python helpers below.
- For **runtime memory monitoring**, read current usage from cgroup too:
  - v2: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.current`
  - v1: `/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.usage_in_bytes`

**Step 2** — Use Step 1 results to pick package variants **before** installing.

Defaults often target the most powerful environment — PyPI's `torch` ships with CUDA libs even on CPU-only hosts. Wrong variant = wasted disk, slow setup, possible import-time failures.

If `=== GPU ===` shows `No GPU`, install torch's CPU build (skips ~4.5GB of CUDA libs):
```bash
uv pip install torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```
Same idea for any library whose wheel selection depends on detected hardware (GPU/CPU-only builds, architecture-specific wheels).

After install, sanity-check imports right away (`python -c "import torch"`). Disk-pressure or interrupted installs leave half-built wheels (e.g. `libtorch_global_deps.so` missing) — catch these before the experiment runs.

**Step 3** — Set Python constants from the Step 1 results:
```python
import os, math, torch, psutil
from pathlib import Path

def _detect_cpus() -> int:
    """Detect actual CPU allocation (containers/pods/bare metal)."""
    try:  # cgroups v2 quota
        parts = Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu.max").read_text().split()
        if parts[0] != "max":
            return math.ceil(int(parts[0]) / int(parts[1]))
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # cgroups v1 quota
        q = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us").read_text())
        p = int(Path("/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_period_us").read_text())
        if q > 0:
            return math.ceil(q / p)
    except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    try:  # CPU affinity (cpuset — used by RunPod, Docker --cpuset-cpus)
        return len(os.sched_getaffinity(0))
    except (AttributeError, OSError): pass
    return os.cpu_count() or 1

def _container_ram_gb() -> float | None:
    """Read RAM limit from cgroup (containers/pods)."""
    for p in ["/sys/fs/cgroup/memory.max", "/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.limit_in_bytes"]:
        try:
            v = Path(p).read_text().strip()
            if v != "max" and int(v) < 1_000_000_000_000:
                return int(v) / 1e9
        except (FileNotFoundError, ValueError): pass
    return None

NUM_CPUS = _detect_cpus()
HAS_GPU = torch.cuda.is_available()
VRAM_GB = torch.cuda.get_device_properties(0).total_mem / 1e9 if HAS_GPU else 0
DEVICE = torch.device("cuda" if HAS_GPU else "cpu")
TOTAL_RAM_GB = _container_ram_gb() or psutil.virtual_memory().total / 1e9
AVAILABLE_RAM_GB = min(psutil.virtual_memory().available / 1e9, TOTAL_RAM_GB)
```

## Step 4 — Set Memory Limits

OOM kills the entire container. **Every script MUST set RAM and VRAM limits at startup.**

Decide the budget based on what the script actually needs. Estimate data size × 2-5x for in-memory overhead, then add ~50% breathing room for temporaries. You may use up to 90% of available RAM/VRAM, but **scale gradually** — start small (e.g. 30-50%), verify it works, then increase toward the limit. Never exceed 90% to keep a buffer for the OS, system processes, and the agent runtime itself. Going over crashes the container/machine with no recovery.

```python
import resource, psutil

_avail = psutil.virtual_memory().available
RAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate what this script needs (in bytes)
assert RAM_BUDGET < _avail, f"Budget {RAM_BUDGET/1e9:.1f}GB > available {_avail/1e9:.1f}GB"
resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_AS, (RAM_BUDGET * 3, RAM_BUDGET * 3))  # 3x: virtual > RSS; raises MemoryError on exceed

if HAS_GPU:
    _free, _total = torch.cuda.mem_get_info(0)
    VRAM_BUDGET = ???  # YOU decide: estimate GPU memory needs
    torch.cuda.set_per_process_memory_fraction(min(VRAM_BUDGET / _total, 0.95))  # raises OutOfMemoryError on exceed
```

## Memory-Safe Data Processing

- **One at a time**: load one large object → process → `del obj; gc.collect()` → next
- **Load only what you need**: select specific tables/columns/rows, not entire databases
- **Test small first**: run on a sample before scaling to full data to estimate memory/time
- **Free intermediates in loops**: don't accumulate large results — aggregate incrementally
- **Size before loading**: check file/dataset size before loading; if it's >30% of `RAM_BUDGET`, chunk it

## Common Mistakes (from real crashes)

- **Skipping this skill entirely** — loading data with no RAM detection, no limits, no budget. Container OOM-killed, all agents lost.
- **Using `psutil.virtual_memory().total` instead of `_container_ram_gb()`** — reports host RAM (e.g. 66 GB) when container limit is 28 GB. You MUST use the cgroup-aware functions above.
- **Loading all tables from a multi-table database at once** — one agent loaded 14 RelBench tables simultaneously, spiked past container limit.
- **Setting no memory limits** — without `resource.setrlimit` (RAM) and `set_per_process_memory_fraction` (VRAM), a runaway script OOM-kills the container instead of raising a catchable error.
- **Using `os.cpu_count()` directly** — returns host CPUs (e.g. 192) instead of container limit (e.g. 4) on RunPod/Docker. Always use `_detect_cpus()` above which checks cgroup quota → CPU affinity → `os.cpu_count()` in order.

## Hardware Use

- Keep these results in mind for ALL subsequent tasks — don't assume more than detected
- GPU if available and parallelizable, multiprocessing if multiple CPUs
- Push available resources to their full potential — don't leave hardware idle

The agent loaded the **aii-parallel-computing** skill; its `SKILL.md` (the instructions injected into the agent's context) follows verbatim.

````
---
name: aii-parallel-computing
description: "Parallelises compute-heavy Python: asyncio with aiohttp and a bounded Semaphore for I/O-bound work, ProcessPoolExecutor under the spawn start method for CPU-bound work, NumPy vectorisation and batched PyTorch on GPU with an out-of-memory halving fallback. ALWAYS read before writing any script that loops over data, issues many API calls, downloads many files, or runs heavy computation — sequential loops are the default failure mode. Triggers: parallelise, make a slow script faster, concurrency, async, aiohttp, asyncio.gather, semaphore, multiprocessing, ProcessPoolExecutor, fork deadlock with loguru, worker count, batch size, CUDA out of memory, idle GPU, retries and rate limits. NOT for detecting what hardware exists or setting RAM and VRAM budgets (aii-use-hardware), staged scale-up against a time budget (aii-long-running-tasks), or provisioning cloud pods (aii-runpod)."
---

**ALWAYS parallelize. Sequential processing is unacceptable for any non-trivial workload.** A sequential script doing 1000 API calls takes hours and fails halfway. An async version finishes in minutes with proper error handling. ALWAYS ask: "Can this run in parallel?" — the answer is almost always yes.

Read aii-use-hardware skill first → get `NUM_CPUS`, `HAS_GPU`, `VRAM_GB`, `device`. Set `NUM_WORKERS` proportional to available CPU capacity — check `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)` and scale accordingly (e.g. 30% used → use ~70% of cores).

## Decision Tree (follow strictly)

- **I/O-bound** (API calls, downloads, web, file reads) → `asyncio` + `aiohttp` with `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`. NEVER do sequential HTTP requests in a loop.
- **CPU-bound, vectorizable** → GPU available: PyTorch on device / No GPU: NumPy vectorized ops. NEVER loop over array elements in Python.
- **CPU-bound, independent items** → `ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=NUM_WORKERS)`. NEVER process items one-by-one when they're independent.
- **Sequential** → only acceptable when items have data dependencies (each depends on the previous result).

## GPU Rules

- Use up to 90% of available VRAM — scale gradually (start small, increase after each successful run, keep 10% buffer)
- Move to device → compute → move back: `torch.tensor(data, device=device)` → `.cpu().numpy()`
- OOM fallback: catch `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` → `empty_cache()` → halve batch size → retry on GPU. Keep reducing until it fits. Stay on GPU.
- Batch large data: chunk it, `del batch` between iterations to free VRAM

## Parallelism Rules

- **CPU-bound**: `ProcessPoolExecutor` + `as_completed`, pre-allocate result list indexed by submission order
- **I/O-bound**: `asyncio` + `aiohttp`, `Semaphore(NUM_WORKERS * 4)`, single shared `ClientSession`, `asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)`
- Always add `tenacity` retries for transient failures, always set timeouts on HTTP requests
- **CRITICAL — `ProcessPoolExecutor` start method**: Default `fork` deadlocks with loguru (and any threading library). ALWAYS pass `mp_context=multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")` when constructing `ProcessPoolExecutor` in any script that uses loguru, threading, or async I/O. Example:
  ```python
  import multiprocessing as mp
  from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor
  with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=N, mp_context=mp.get_context("spawn")) as pool:
      ...
  ```

title: SSHPC vs Proxy-Model Compression Benchmark
summary: >-
  Implement Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (target LLM's own next-token logits) and compare against LLMLingua, SelectiveContext,
  Random, and Proxy-on-target baselines on Llama-3-8B and Qwen2-7B across GSM8K, HotpotQA, LongBench, and NaturalQuestions
  at 2x-10x compression, measuring EM/F1/ROUGE and prefill-vs-generation latency.
runpod_compute_profile: gpu_a100
implementation_pseudocode: |-
  === PIPELINE OVERVIEW ===

  1. DATASET LOADING (scripts/01_load_data.py)
     - Load GSM8K, HotpotQA, NaturalQuestions, LongBench subsets from HuggingFace
     - Subset to ~500 prompts per dataset for time budget
     - Create 'prompt' strings and ground-truth answer fields

  2. SURPRISAL COMPUTATION (core/sshpc.py)
     - SurprisalAnalyzer class: single forward pass through target LM yields all position logits
     - compute_surprisal(text) -> [-log P(token_i | context up to i-1)] for each token
     - Special token handling: assign INF surprisal to BOS, EOS, system/instruction tokens
     - Query-conditioning variant: compute P(token | context + last_user_message) via cross-attention mask

  3. SSHPC COMPRESSION (core/sshpc.py)
     - compute_token_importance(prompt, query=None) -> ranked token list by surprisal
     - prune_lowest_surprisal(tokens, target_ratio) -> compressed prompt
     - iterative_rescore(prompt, target_ratio, rounds=3): recompute surprisal after each pruning round (for >=8x)
     - keep_special_tokens() preserves instruction/query tokens permanently

  4. BASELINE METHODS (core/baselines.py)
     - LLMLingua: GPT-2 as proxy model, iterative minimum-entropy scoring (from official code)
     - SelectiveContext: GPT-2 self-information scoring
     - Random pruning: random token removal at same ratio
     - No compression: original prompt
     - Proxy-on-target ablation: LLMLingua algorithm but with target LLM as proxy (single-pass, no iterative conditioning)

  5. TASK EVALUATION (evaluation/evaluators.py)
     - GSM8K: generate answers, execute Python code, pass@1 accuracy
     - HotpotQA: generate answers, compute EM/F1
     - LongBench QA subset: EM/F1
     - NaturalQuestions: EM@1, F1@1

  6. LATENCY MEASUREMENT (core/latency.py)
     - Prefill time: time for model to process compressed prompt (first token generation)
     - Generation time: time per generated token after prefill
     - Break-even ratio: compression_ratio where prefill_savings = generation_overhead

  7. EXPERIMENT ORCHESTRATOR (run_experiment.py)
     For each model in [Llama-3-8B, Qwen2-7B]:
       For each dataset in [GSM8K, HotpotQA, LongBench_QA, NQ]:
         For each method in [SSHPC, SSHPC_iterative, LLMLingua, SelectiveContext, Random, ProxyOnTarget, None]:
           For each ratio in [2x, 4x, 8x, 10x]:
             - Load ~500 prompts
             - Compute compressed prompts
             - Run task generation
             - Compute metrics + latency
             - Save results to method_out.json

  === KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS ===

  Surprisal computation (single forward pass):
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors='pt')
    with torch.no_grad():
      logits = model(**inputs).logits  # [1, seq_len, vocab]
    shift_logits = logits[:, :-1, :]
    shift_targets = inputs['input_ids'][:, 1:]
    log_probs = F.log_softmax(shift_logits, dim=-1)
    log_pt = gather(log_probs, shift_targets)  # log P(true token)
    surprisals = -log_pt

  Special token protection:
    special_ids = set(tokenizer.all_special_ids) + instruction_token_ids
    surprisals[special_positions] = float('inf')

  Query-conditioning:
    For QA tasks: condition P(token | context + query) where query = last user message
    Implementation: prepend query to context, compute surprisal for context tokens only (positions after query length)

  Iterative re-scoring (for >=8x):
    for round in 3:
      compute surprisals on current compressed prompt
      prune lowest-surprisal tokens to reach next compression milestone
      re-tokenize and recompute

  Output format (method_out.json):

fallback_plan: >-
  If target LLM inference is too slow or OOMs on A100: (1) Reduce model to Qwen2-7B only, drop Llama-3-8B; (2) Reduce prompt
  subset to 200 per dataset; (3) Use float8 quantization (bitsandbytes) to fit models; (4) Use smaller context windows (truncate
  prompts to 4K tokens). If proxy-model methods (LLMLingua) fail due to GPT-2 loading issues: implement from scratch using
  GPT-2 nano (124M params) with minimum-entropy scoring as described in the original paper. If task evaluation via code execution
  fails for GSM8K: use regex extraction of final number as fallback. If latency measurement is unreliable due to CUDA caching:
  use warmup + median of 10 runs per prompt.
testing_plan: >-
  PHASE 1 (30 min): Verify surprisal computation correctness by comparing computed perplexity against lm-evaluation-harness
  on a 10-prompt subset for both models. PHASE 2 (30 min): Test compression pipeline end-to-end on 5 prompts per dataset —
  verify special tokens preserved, compression ratios match targets, iterative re-scoring produces correct ratios. PHASE 3
  (1 hour): Run full evaluation on 50 prompts per dataset per method to catch bugs. PHASE 4 (4 hours): Full run with 500 prompts
  per dataset. Confirmation signals: (a) perplexity matches expected values within 0.01, (b) compression ratio exactly matches
  target (within 1%), (c) special tokens never pruned, (d) latency measurements are stable across repeated runs. Kill-switch:
  if any method crashes or produces NaN metrics, skip that method and log the error.

Maximize parallel tool calls. Parallelize independent operations, only sequentialize dependencies.
- Multiple searches/fetches on different topics → parallel in one turn
- Search then fetch results → sequential (need URLs first)
</tool_use>

<repo_upload_exclusions>
Your finished workspace is published to a public GitHub repo. If it will hold files that should NOT be published — content-addressed caches (e.g. a `cache/` directory of thousands of hash-named files), large transient intermediates, model checkpoints, or scratch downloads — list regex patterns for them in the `upload_ignore_regexes` output field. Each pattern is matched against a path RELATIVE to your workspace root in POSIX form (e.g. `(^|/)cache/`, `(^|/)checkpoints/`). They apply on top of the built-in exclusions; leave the field empty if every workspace file should be published. Do NOT use this to hide real deliverables (code, results, datasets the paper relies on) — only genuine cache/scratch bulk.

IMPORTANT: Your final response should be at most 300 characters long.

FIRST, add ALL of these to your todo list using your task/todo-tracking tool:

CRITICAL: Todo content must be copied exactly as is written here, with NO CHANGES. These todos are intentionally detailed so that another LLM could read each one without any external context and understand exactly what it has to do.

<todos>
TODO 1. Use aii-json skill's format script with `--input method_out.json` to generate full, mini, and preview versions. If not in your workspace (see <workspace> above), copy them there. Run 'ls -lh' to verify these three files exist (DO NOT read them).
TODO 2. Apply aii-file-size-limit skill's file size check procedure (100MB limit) to method_out.json and full_method_out.json.
TODO 3. Ensure a `pyproject.toml` exists in your workspace with ALL dependencies pinned to the exact versions installed in your .venv (run `.venv/bin/pip freeze` to get them). This is required for reproducibility. The [project] section must include name, version, requires-python, and a dependencies list with pinned versions (e.g. `numpy==2.0.2`, not `numpy>=2.0`).
</todos>

STOP. You have reached the maximum number of turns.

Do NOT use any more tools. Finish what you are doing and provide your final output NOW.

Use whatever information you have gathered so far to produce the best response possible.

<validation-feedback>
Attempt 1 failed validation.

The output file `.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json` does not exist yet. Produce it as JSON matching the schema.

Produce `.sdk_openhands_agent_struct_out.json` again so it contains corrected JSON that matches the schema. Do not invent new fields.

The following required files are missing:

- `mini_method_out.json`
- `preview_method_out.json`

Create these files now. The task is not complete until all required files exist.

IMPORTANT: When providing your structured output (title, summary, etc.), describe the ARTIFACT you built — NOT the file verification status. Your title and summary must describe what you created, not that you verified files.

<file_errors>
MISSING OR UNREADABLE FILES:
  - Missing file: method.py
  - Missing file: full_method_out.json

Fix: Create the missing files directly in your workspace (see <workspace> above for the exact path).
     Required files: method.py, method_out.json, full_method_out.json, mini_method_out.json, preview_method_out.json
     Use 'ls' to check what files exist.
</file_errors>

<schema_errors>
JSON SCHEMA / CODE VALIDATION ERRORS:
  - mini_method_out.json: Missing required 'datasets' key
  - preview_method_out.json: Missing required 'datasets' key

Fix: Your JSON files must follow the datasets-grouped exp_gen_sol_out.json schema:
     {
       "datasets": [
         {
           "dataset": "dataset_name",
           "examples": [
             {
               "input": "string (required)",
               "output": "string (required)",
               "metadata_fold": 2,
               "predict_<method_name>": "string - prediction per method"
             }
           ]
         }
       ]
     }

     NO 'split', 'dataset', or 'context' per-example. Dataset name at group level.
     Metadata via flat metadata_<name> fields.
     Read exp_gen_sol_out.json schema in aii-json skill.
     Then update method.py and regenerate the output files.

     If Python syntax errors: fix the syntax in method.py
</schema_errors>

<task>
FIX THESE ISSUES:
1. Create all missing files by running method.py
2. Fix schema/syntax errors in method.py
3. Re-run method.py to regenerate output files
4. Validate with aii-json skill: validate method_out.json against exp_gen_sol_out schema

After making changes, verify:
- 'ls -la' shows all required files
- 'uv run method.py' completes successfully
- JSON files are valid (use aii-json skill validation)
- full_method_out.json has at least 50 examples
</task>
