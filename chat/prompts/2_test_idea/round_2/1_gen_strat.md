title: Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression
hypothesis: >-
  A target LLM's own next-token prediction surprisal (negative log-likelihood) on its input prompt provides a more accurate
  importance signal for hard token pruning than any proxy model's perplexity, because it directly measures what the target
  model itself finds predictable versus surprising — eliminating the proxy-model mismatch that plagues current methods like
  LLMLingua and SelectiveContext. SSHPC uses iterative re-scoring at high compression ratios (>=8x) where single-pass context
  dependence degrades rankings, preserves special/instruction tokens by assigning infinite surprisal, generalizes query-conditioning
  to arbitrary task specifications (last user message, instruction prefix), and measures actual prefill latency against generation
  savings to establish a break-even compression ratio. This operationalizes the rate-distortion principle (Nagle et al., 2024)
  and SelfCP's target-model compressor insight as a training-free hard-pruning method.
motivation: >-
  All existing hard prompt compression methods (LLMLingua, LongLLMLingua, LLMLingua-2, SelectiveContext, ProCut) rely on a
  smaller proxy model (GPT-2, BERT, or fine-tuned small LM) to score token importance via perplexity or self-information.
  This creates a fundamental proxy-model mismatch: the proxy's predictions don't match the target LLM's, leading to suboptimal
  pruning. Meanwhile, soft prompt methods (SelfCP, ICAE, GIST) use the target LLM but produce dense vectors requiring learnable
  connectors and training. No method uses the target LLM's own next-token logits to directly compute per-token surprisal for
  hard token pruning. Predictive coding theory from neuroscience suggests that only 'surprising' inputs (high prediction error)
  carry new information for a predictive system; tokens the model predicts well are self-redundant. This hypothesis bridges
  that gap.
assumptions:
- >-
  Target LLM exposes next-token logits/probabilities for prompt tokens (available for local models via HuggingFace, some APIs)
- >-
  Surprisal computed as -log P(token | preceding context) under the target LLM's own distribution correlates with token importance
  for that model's generation
- >-
  Low-surprisal tokens are genuinely self-redundant for the target model (not just predictable in general)
- >-
  Hard token pruning based on self-surprisal preserves task performance better than proxy-model perplexity at equal compression
  ratios
- >-
  Single forward pass to compute all token surprisals is computationally feasible within budget
investigation_approach: >-
  1. Implement Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (SSHPC): for each prompt token, compute -log P(token | preceding context)
  using target LLM's forward pass; prune lowest-surprisal tokens to target compression ratio. 2. Compare against LLMLingua,
  LLMLingua-2, SelectiveContext, and random pruning baselines on LongBench, NaturalQuestions, GSM8K, and HotpotQA. 3. Test
  across multiple target LLMs (Llama-3-8B, Qwen2-7B, Mistral-7B) and compression ratios (2x, 4x, 8x, 10x). 4. Measure task
  accuracy, hallucination rate, and inference latency. 5. Ablate: compare self-surprisal vs. proxy-model perplexity on same
  target LLM to isolate proxy-mismatch effect.
success_criteria: >-
  CONFIRMED if: (a) SSHPC matches or exceeds LLMLingua-2 task accuracy at equal/higher compression ratios on >=3/4 benchmarks;
  (b) SSHPC outperforms proxy-model baselines by >=2% absolute accuracy at high compression (8x+); (c) Ablation shows proxy-model
  perplexity on same target LLM degrades vs self-surprisal, confirming proxy-mismatch as key factor. DISCONFIRMED if: SSHPC
  consistently underperforms proxy baselines, or self-surprisal correlates poorly with actual token importance measured via
  leave-one-out ablation.

inspiration: >-
  Cross-domain transfer from neuroscience (predictive coding / Free Energy Principle) and information theory (rate-distortion).
  Predictive coding posits the brain minimizes surprisal by predicting next inputs; only prediction errors (high surprisal)
  propagate up the hierarchy — predictable inputs are 'explained away' as redundant. Applied to LLMs: tokens the target model
  predicts well from context carry little new information for its own generation. This is a Level 3 methodological transfer
  — importing the concrete mechanism of surprisal-based filtering from predictive coding directly as a hard prompt compression
  algorithm.

  hypothesis: >-
    Computing token surprisal conditioned on the query/task (P(token | context + query)) rather than context alone yields

    task.

    If query-specific information is the primary driver of token importance (as LongLLMLingua's question-aware compression

- title: Attention-Weighted Self-Surprisal
  hypothesis: >-
    Weighting each token's self-surprisal by its attention mass (how much subsequent tokens attend to it) produces a more
    accurate importance score than raw surprisal alone, because it captures both self-predictability and causal influence
    on generation.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If some low-surprisal tokens are causally critical (e.g., rare but pivotal keywords that subsequent tokens heavily attend
    to), pure surprisal would incorrectly prune them. Attention-weighting corrects this by incorporating the target LLM's
    own causal dependency structure.
- title: Iterative Self-Surprisal Refinement
  hypothesis: >-
    Iteratively recomputing self-surprisal after each pruning round (since context changes) yields better compression than
    single-pass scoring, because token predictability shifts as surrounding tokens are removed.
  why_it_could_win: >-
    If token surprisal is highly context-dependent (as LLMLingua's iterative compression suggests), single-pass scoring based
    on the original context becomes stale. Iterative recomputation adapts to the evolving compressed context, potentially

title: 'Wide Screen: Self-Surprisal Variants for Hard Prompt Compression'
objective: >-
  Run a coarse-grained parallel screen of four Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (SSHPC) variants against proxy-model
  baselines to identify which candidate deserves deep testing in iteration 2. The screen tests the main hypothesis (single-pass
  self-surprisal) plus three alternates (query-conditioned, attention-weighted, iterative refinement) on identical benchmarks
  and metrics.
rationale: >-
  The hypothesis space has four distinct mechanistic answers to the same question (how to use target LLM's own predictions
  for hard token pruning): (1) base self-surprisal, (2) query-conditioned surprisal, (3) attention-weighted surprisal, (4)
  iterative surprisal. Only one can be right for a given regime. A wide screen tests all four cheaply in parallel on the same
  evidence, then confirms the survivor on held-out data in iteration 2. This avoids the default failure mode of deepening
  a single candidate that may be the wrong mechanism.

# Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression

## Abstract

Hard prompt compression methods such as LLMLingua, SelectiveContext, and LLMLingua-2 rely on a smaller proxy model to score token importance via perplexity or self-information. This creates a fundamental proxy-model mismatch: the proxy's predictions do not match the target LLM's, leading to suboptimal pruning. We propose Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (SSHPC), which uses the target LLM's own next-token logits to compute per-token surprisal — the negative log-likelihood of each token given its preceding context — and prunes the lowest-surprisal tokens. Grounded in predictive coding theory, this eliminates the proxy mismatch while avoiding the training overhead and soft-token complexity of methods like SelfCP. We describe the algorithm, analyze its theoretical basis, and outline an evaluation on four long-context benchmarks across three open-weight LLMs at compression ratios from 2x to 10x.

## 1 Introduction

Large language models have become central to applications ranging from retrieval-augmented generation to multi-step reasoning. As these systems incorporate chain-of-thought prompting, in-context learning, and retrieved documents, prompt lengths routinely exceed thousands of tokens. This increases inference latency, memory consumption, and API costs proportionally to sequence length.

Existing hard prompt compression methods address this by removing tokens deemed unimportant. LLMLingua and SelectiveContext compute token-level perplexity or self-information using a small proxy model such as GPT-2 or LLaMA-7B, then discard tokens with low scores. LLMLingua-2 distills a classifier from a proxy model's outputs. All three share the same limitation: the proxy model's internal representations and prediction distributions differ from the target LLM's, so its importance scores are systematically misaligned with what the target model actually finds surprising or predictable. This proxy-model mismatch causes suboptimal pruning, especially at high compression ratios where each retained token must carry maximal information for the target model.

Soft prompt methods such as GIST, ICAE, AutoCompressor, and SelfCP use the target LLM itself but produce dense continuous vectors that require learnable connectors and supervised training on long-context data. They do not preserve the original discrete token sequence, limiting compatibility with black-box APIs and introducing additional engineering complexity.

Why has self-surprisal not been used for hard pruning? Two practical barriers exist. First, many API-only models do not expose per-token logits for prompt tokens. Second, computing a full forward pass over a long prompt to obtain logits for every position adds latency that may offset compression gains. Recent open-weight models (Llama-3, Qwen2, Mistral) and efficient batched inference have reduced both barriers, making self-surprisal computationally feasible and directly accessible.

We propose Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (SSHPC). For each token in the prompt, we compute its surprisal under the target LLM's own next-token prediction distribution: the negative log probability of the token given all preceding tokens. Tokens the model predicts confidently (low surprisal) are self-redundant for that model; tokens that violate its predictions (high surprisal) carry new information. We prune the lowest-surprisal tokens to meet a target compression ratio. This uses the target model's own predictive coding machinery as the importance signal, eliminating the proxy mismatch entirely.

Our contributions are:

## 2 Related Work

### Hard Prompt Compression via Proxy Models

LLMLingua (Jiang et al., 2023) introduced a coarse-to-fine framework using a small language model (GPT-2 or Alpaca-7B) to compute token perplexity. A budget controller allocates different compression ratios to instructions, demonstrations, and questions, followed by iterative token-level compression that conditions on previously retained tokens. LongLLMLingua (Jiang et al., 2024) extends this with question-aware compression and document reordering to address position bias in long contexts. LLMLingua-2 (Pan et al., 2024) replaces the iterative process with a data distillation pipeline: a small Transformer encoder (XLM-RoBERTa-large) is trained to classify tokens as keep/discard using labels derived from the proxy model's perplexity scores.

SelectiveContext (Li, 2023) computes self-information (negative log probability) of noun phrases identified by spaCy dependency parsing, then filters phrases below a threshold. Like LLMLingua, it relies on a small LM's probability estimates rather than the target model's.

All these methods suffer from proxy-model mismatch. The small LM's vocabulary, architecture, and training distribution differ from the target LLM's, so its perplexity rankings correlate imperfectly with the target's actual sensitivity to token removal. Jiang et al. (2023) mitigate this via instruction tuning the proxy on target-LLM outputs, but alignment remains incomplete.

### Soft Prompt Compression

GIST (Mu et al., 2023) appends trainable "gist tokens" that attend to the full prompt; subsequent generation attends only to gist tokens. AutoCompressor (Chevalier et al., 2023) recursively compresses prompt segments into soft tokens. ICAE (Ge et al., 2023) uses a LoRA-adapted LLM as encoder to compress contexts into virtual tokens, with the frozen LLM as decoder. These methods require fine-tuning the encoder or the full model, and the compressed representations are model-specific dense vectors unusable with black-box APIs.

SelfCP (Gao et al., 2024) uses the target LLM itself as both compressor and generator. The compressor processes over-limit prompt segments, and a learned linear connector projects the final hidden states into "memory tokens" understood by the generator. Only the connector (17M parameters) is trained; the LLM stays frozen. SelfCP achieves 12× compression but still produces soft tokens and requires training the connector on long-context data.

### Theoretical Frameworks

Nagle et al. (2024) formalize prompt compression as a rate-distortion problem for black-box LLMs. They derive the distortion-rate function as a linear program and show a large gap between existing heuristics and the optimal strategy. Their analysis highlights the importance of query-aware compression but does not propose a self-surprisal method.

Predictive coding (Friston, 2009) posits that hierarchical neural systems minimize free energy by predicting incoming inputs; only prediction errors (surprisal) propagate upward. Applied to LLMs: tokens the model predicts well from context are "explained away" as redundant for that model's generation. This provides a principled justification for self-surprisal as the importance signal.

## 3 Method

### 3.1 Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression

Let the target LLM be $M$ with vocabulary $\mathcal{V}$ and context window $L$. Given a prompt $\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, \dots, x_N)$ with $N \le L$, we compute the surprisal of each token under $M$'s next-token distribution:

$$s_i = -\log P_M(x_i \mid x_{<i}) \quad \text{for } i = 1, \dots, N$$

where $x_{<i} = (x_1, \dots, x_{i-1})$ and $P_M$ is $M$'s next-token probability distribution (obtained via a forward pass with causal masking). For the first token $x_1$, we use the unconditional distribution $P_M(x_1)$.

Given a target compression ratio $r \ge 1$ (i.e., retain $N/r$ tokens), we select the top-$k = \lfloor N/r \rfloor$ tokens with highest surprisal scores, preserving their original relative order. The compressed prompt $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$ is the subsequence of these tokens.

**Implementation details.** We obtain all $s_i$ in a single forward pass by feeding the full prompt to $M$ and reading the logits at each position. For models with grouped-query attention, we use standard causal masking. The computation is $\mathcal{O}(N \cdot d)$ where $d$ is model dimension, comparable to one generation step. We optionally preserve special tokens (e.g., `<bos>`, `<eos>`, instruction delimiters) by assigning them infinite surprisal.

**Variants.** (1) *Unconditional SSHPC*: surprisal computed on the prompt alone as above. (2) *Query-conditioned SSHPC*: for QA/RAG prompts structured as (context, question), we compute $s_i = -\log P_M(x_i \mid x_{<i}, \text{question})$, so context tokens are scored by how surprising they are given the question. This aligns with LongLLMLingua's finding that question-awareness improves compression.

[FIGURE:fig2]

### 3.2 Theoretical Motivation: Predictive Coding and Self-Surprisal

Predictive coding (Friston, 2009) frames perception as hierarchical Bayesian inference: each level predicts the activity of the level below, and only the prediction error (surprisal) is forwarded. In an LLM, the next-token prediction head implements exactly this: at each layer, the residual stream carries a prediction of the next token; the difference between prediction and actual input is the surprisal.

Formally, let the prompt $\mathbf{x}$ be generated by a stochastic process. The target LLM $M$ defines a conditional distribution $P_M(x_i \mid x_{<i})$. The pointwise mutual information between $x_i$ and $x_{<i}$ under $M$ is $\log \frac{P_M(x_i \mid x_{<i})}{P_M(x_i)}$. Its expectation over $P_M$ is the conditional entropy; the pointwise quantity $-\log P_M(x_i \mid x_{<i})$ is the self-information or surprisal.

If $s_i$ is low, $M$ already "expects" $x_i$ given $x_{<i}$; removing $x_i$ does not change $M$'s internal state significantly because the prediction was already accurate. If $s_i$ is high, $x_i$ carries information $M$ did not predict; removing it forces $M$ to generate from a context that diverges from what it would have seen. Thus self-surprisal directly measures each token's causal contribution to $M$'s subsequent computation.

This differs from proxy-model perplexity: a proxy model $M'$ computes $-\log P_{M'}(x_i \mid x_{<i})$, which measures how surprising $x_i$ is to $M'$, not to $M$. The mismatch $P_M \ne P_{M'}$ is the root cause of suboptimal pruning.

### 3.3 Computational Considerations

SSHPC requires one forward pass over the full prompt. For a prompt of length $N$, the forward pass computes all $N$ surprisal values simultaneously using the model's KV cache. The latency overhead is approximately one generation step per $N$ tokens (batched). For $N=4096$ on Llama-3-8B, this is $\sim$50ms on an A100 — comparable to or less than the inference time saved by compressing the prompt for the downstream task.

At very long contexts ($N > 8192$), we can chunk the prompt and compute surprisal within each chunk, or use a sliding window. We leave chunked computation to future work.

## 4 Experimental Design

### 4.1 Datasets and Tasks

We evaluate on four benchmarks covering diverse long-context tasks:

- **LongBench** (Bai et al., 2023): Bilingual multi-task benchmark including single-doc QA, multi-doc QA, summarization, few-shot learning, and code completion. Context lengths 5k–15k tokens.
- **NaturalQuestions** (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019): Multi-document open-domain QA. We use the multi-document setting with 10 retrieved documents per question.
- **GSM8K** (Cobbe et al., 2021): Multi-step mathematical reasoning with chain-of-thought prompts. Tests whether compression preserves reasoning structure.
- **HotpotQA** (Yang et al., 2018): Multi-hop reasoning over multiple documents. Tests whether compression preserves cross-document dependencies.

### 4.2 Target Models and Baselines

**Target LLMs** (all open-weight, local inference):
- Llama-3-8B-Instruct
- Qwen2-7B-Instruct
- Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3

**Baselines**:
1. **No compression** (full prompt)
2. **Random pruning**: uniform random token removal
3. **SelectiveContext** (Li, 2023): self-information from LLaMA-7B proxy
4. **LLMLingua** (Jiang et al., 2023): proxy-model perplexity with iterative compression
5. **LLMLingua-2** (Pan et al., 2024): distilled classifier from proxy model
6. **SelfCP** (Gao et al., 2024): soft prompt compression using target LLM (where applicable)

**Ablation baselines**:
7. **Proxy-on-target ablation**: Run LLMLingua/SelectiveContext using the *same* target LLM as the proxy (i.e., Llama-3-8B scoring for Llama-3-8B target). This ablation isolates the proxy-mismatch effect.

### 4.3 Compression Ratios and Metrics

Compression ratios: 2x, 4x, 8x, 10x (i.e., retain 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 10% of tokens).

**Primary metrics**:
- Task accuracy (Exact Match for GSM8K, F1/EM for QA, ROUGE-L for summarization)
- Hallucination rate (for QA: fraction of answers containing unsupported claims)
- End-to-end latency (compression + generation) on A100-40GB

**Secondary metrics**:
- Compression throughput (tokens/sec for the compression step alone)
- Surprisal distribution statistics (mean, variance, skew)

### 4.4 Ablation Studies

1. **Proxy mismatch isolation**: Compare SSHPC against Proxy-on-target ablation. If SSHPC outperforms, the gain is not merely from using a larger proxy but from using the *target's own* distribution.
2. **Unconditional vs. query-conditioned**: On NaturalQuestions and HotpotQA, compare SSHPC with and without question conditioning.
3. **Single-pass vs. iterative**: After initial SSHPC compression, recompute surprisal on the compressed prompt and prune again. Test if iterative refinement helps at 8x–10x ratios.
4. **Surprisal threshold vs. top-k**: Compare fixed-threshold pruning (keep tokens with $s_i > \tau$) against fixed-ratio top-k.

[FIGURE:fig4]

## 5 Discussion

### 5.1 Expected Outcomes

We hypothesize that SSHPC will match or exceed LLMLingua-2 accuracy at equal or higher compression ratios on at least three of four benchmarks. At high compression (8x+), the proxy-mismatch effect should become pronounced, yielding $\ge 2\%$ absolute accuracy gains over proxy baselines. The Proxy-on-target ablation should confirm that self-surprisal outperforms proxy perplexity even when the proxy *is* the target model, because proxy methods compute perplexity on the *original* context while SSHPC's surprisal is inherently conditioned on the same context the target will see.

### 5.2 Limitations

**Logit access requirement**: SSHPC requires access to the target LLM's next-token logits for prompt tokens. This is available for local models (HuggingFace, vLLM) and some APIs (e.g., OpenAI's `logprobs` parameter), but not all. For fully black-box APIs, proxy methods remain the only option.

**Single-pass context dependence**: Surprisal is computed on the original full prompt. After pruning, the context for each retained token changes, potentially altering its true importance. The iterative ablation (Section 4.4) addresses this.

**First-token handling**: The first token has no preceding context. The method uses the unconditional distribution, which may not reflect its true importance in the full prompt. An alternative would score it using a bidirectional model's pseudo-log-likelihood (Salazar et al., 2020), but this reintroduces a proxy.

**No query in unconditional variant**: For prompts without a clear question (e.g., summarization, chat), query-conditioned SSHPC does not apply. The unconditional variant may retain tokens that are predictable globally but surprising for the specific task.

### 5.3 Broader Implications

If self-surprisal proves effective, it suggests that the target LLM's own predictive coding machinery is a sufficient importance signal for compression — no external model, no training, no distillation. This aligns with the rate-distortion framework of Nagle et al. (2024): the optimal compressor for a given decoder is the decoder's own prediction error. SSHPC operationalizes this principle for hard token pruning.

## 6 Conclusion

We proposed Self-Surprisal Hard Prompt Compression (SSHPC), a training-free hard prompt compression method that uses the target LLM's own next-token logits to score token importance. By eliminating the proxy-model mismatch inherent in LLMLingua, SelectiveContext, and LLMLingua-2, and avoiding the soft-token complexity and training overhead of SelfCP, GIST, and ICAE, SSHPC offers a minimal, principled alternative grounded in predictive coding theory. Our evaluation design tests SSHPC across diverse long-context tasks, target models, and compression ratios, with ablations that isolate the proxy-mismatch effect. If confirmed, SSHPC would establish self-surprisal as the canonical importance signal for hard prompt compression on open-weight LLMs.

<reviewer_feedback>
Paper reviewer feedback from the previous iteration. Your strategy MUST address these critiques.
Prioritize major issues — these are the most impactful improvements to make.

- [MAJOR] (scope) The paper does not answer the user's original request. The request was: 'Survey simple prompt-compression techniques that shrink LLM context length without hurting task accuracy.' This paper proposes a NOVEL method (SSHPC) with an evaluation design — it is not a survey. Coverage is 'lost'.
  Action: Either (a) rewrite as a survey paper covering the 6+ methods documented in the research artifacts (SelectiveContext, LLMLingua, LLMLingua-2, SelfCP, ASAP, PIS, etc.) with implementation details and comparison tables, or (b) acknowledge this is a different research direction and the survey was a separate deliverable.
- [MAJOR] (evidence) No experimental results are reported. The paper describes an 'evaluation design' and 'expected outcomes' but every quantitative claim is projected/placeholder. The abstract says 'We describe the algorithm, analyze its theoretical basis, and outline an evaluation' — this is accurate but makes it a proposal, not a completed study. Results_reported = false.
  Action: Execute the full experimental plan. At minimum, run a subset (1-2 datasets, 1-2 models, key baselines) to have ANY empirical evidence before submission. Without results, this cannot be accepted at a top-tier venue.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) The single-pass context dependence problem is fundamental: surprisal is computed on the FULL prompt, but after pruning, the context for each retained token changes. The paper acknowledges this and proposes an iterative ablation, but doesn't commit to it as the main method. At high compression ratios (8x-10x), this could significantly degrade performance because the model's predictions on the compressed prompt will differ from its predictions on the original.
  Action: Make iterative re-scoring the default for high compression ratios (>=8x), or provide a theoretical bound on how much surprisal rankings can change after pruning. Alternatively, use a bidirectional model's pseudo-log-likelihood (Salazar et al. 2020) for more context-independent scores, though this reintroduces a proxy.
- [MAJOR] (methodology) Computational overhead is underestimated for practical deployment. A full forward pass on the target LLM (e.g., Llama-3-8B) over 4096 tokens is NOT ~50ms on A100 — that's closer to a single generation step for SHORT sequences. For a 4096-token prompt, the prefill latency is substantial (hundreds of ms). The paper must measure actual prefill time vs. generation savings.
  Action: Measure and report actual compression latency (prefill time for the full prompt) vs. generation time saved. Compare against the proxy-model approaches (which use much smaller models for scoring). If SSHPC's overhead exceeds savings at low compression ratios, state the break-even point clearly.
- [MAJOR] (novelty) The novelty claim is overstated. SelfCP (Gao et al. 2024) already uses 'the target LLM itself' for compression. The difference is soft vs. hard tokens, but the core insight — the target model's own representations are the right importance signal — is shared. Nagle et al. (2024) formalize prompt compression as rate-distortion and imply the optimal compressor is the decoder's own prediction error. The paper should position SSHPC as 'hard-token operationalization of the SelfCP/rate-distortion principle' rather than a wholly new idea.
  Action: Reframe the contribution: 'We show that the target model's own next-token surprisal — a signal already implicit in SelfCP's compressor and Nagle et al.'s rate-distortion framework — yields an effective training-free HARD compression method.' Cite Nagle et al. 2024 more centrally as theoretical precedent.
- [MINOR] (rigor) The first-token handling is a gap: x_1 uses the unconditional distribution, which doesn't reflect its importance in context. The paper mentions Salazar et al. (2020) masked LM scoring as an alternative but dismisses it as 'reintroducing a proxy'. This is a real issue for prompts where the first tokens are critical (e.g., instruction tokens).
  Action: Either: (a) always preserve special/instruction tokens (assign infinite surprisal), (b) use a sliding window where each token is scored with a fixed context window behind it, or (c) implement and test the bidirectional pseudo-log-likelihood approach. Report what works.
- [MINOR] (clarity) The query-conditioned variant is only defined for QA/RAG prompts with a clear question. For summarization, chat, or open-ended prompts, there's no 'question' to condition on. The paper doesn't address how to handle these common cases.
  Action: Define a general conditioning mechanism: for any prompt, identify the 'query' or 'task specification' portion (e.g., the last user message in chat, the instruction in summarization) and condition on that. Or provide a heuristic for automatic query extraction.
- [MINOR] (rigor) The proxy-on-target ablation (running LLMLingua/SelectiveContext with the target LLM as proxy) is a great design but the paper predicts SSHPC will outperform it 'because proxy methods compute perplexity on the original context while SSHPC's surprisal is inherently conditioned on the same context the target will see.' This reasoning needs verification — both methods score on the original context. The difference is perplexity vs. surprisal and iterative vs. single-pass.
  Action: Clarify the theoretical distinction. Perplexity = exp(avg surprisal) over a segment; SSHPC uses pointwise surprisal. The key difference may be granularity (token vs. segment) and the lack of iterative conditioning in SSHPC. Test both.
- [MINOR] (evidence) The paper cites Nagle et al. (2024) as 'NeurIPS 2024' but the paper appears to be from NeurIPS 2024 (published Dec 2024). The citation format should be consistent — use the proceedings citation if available, or arXiv with the correct year.
  Action: Verify all citations are accurate and complete. The Nagle et al. paper is arXiv:2407.15504 / NeurIPS 2024. Ensure the bibliography entry matches the venue.

<task>
Generate 1 research strategy for THIS iteration.

**ARTIFACT LIMIT: Each strategy may contain AT MOST 3 artifact directions.** Focus on the highest-impact artifacts. Quality over quantity.

Each strategy should:
1. Define a clear OBJECTIVE - what novel contribution we're building toward
2. Plan artifacts to execute NOW - specify type, objective, approach, and depends_on for each
3. Account for parallel execution - all strategies and all planned artifacts run simultaneously, their artifacts are combined into one shared pool

**BROADER IS NOT THE SAME AS DEEPER.** This applies when you are going DEEPER
on a claim that already has support — it is not an argument against a wide
screen, which tests DIFFERENT candidate answers rather than the same one in
more places. Adding models, datasets, or settings to an experiment that
already ran makes the table bigger; it does not make the contribution
stronger, and it is the default a strategy generator drifts into when it has
nothing sharper to propose. Spend an artifact on scale only when the SPREAD
itself is the finding (a scaling trend, a regime boundary, a generalisation
claim the paper actually makes). Otherwise spend it on something that could
change the conclusion: the mechanism behind an observed effect, the condition
under which it disappears, the confound that would explain it away, or the
baseline whose absence a reviewer would name first.

description: "Searches, previews, and downloads machine-learning datasets from the HuggingFace Hub catalogue — configs, splits, features and a loadable flag — saving full, mini and preview JSON files. Use whenever a task needs training data, an evaluation corpus, or a named public benchmark hosted on HuggingFace, and whenever candidate datasets must be discovered, compared and sampled before one is chosen. Triggers: HuggingFace, HF Hub, datasets library, dataset search or discovery, training data, benchmark corpus, parquet shards, configs and splits, dataset card, org/name dataset repo ids. NOT for: country-level global indicator statistics on energy, health, economics or demographics, which aii-owid-datasets covers; validating or reshaping JSON already on disk, which aii-json covers; plotting the numbers, which aii-data-fig-gen covers."

## Contents

- Workflow (3-phase dataset discovery)
- Scripts (Search, Preview, Download)

**IMPORTANT - Parallel execution:** GNU `parallel` subshells do NOT inherit `source activate`. Use `export` for variables and **single-quoted** command templates so parallel's subshells can resolve them:
```
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets"
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python"
```

---

## Workflow: 3-Phase Dataset Discovery

### Phase 1: Search for Datasets
Find datasets with metadata (configs, splits, features, sizes)
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "sentiment analysis" --limit 5
```

### Phase 2: Preview Dataset (if promising)
Inspect metadata AND sample rows in one call
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k
```

### Phase 3: Download Dataset (if suitable)
Download after reviewing the preview
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --config main --split train
```

---

## Scripts

### Search HuggingFace Datasets (aii_hf_search_datasets.py)

Search and discover datasets on HuggingFace Hub.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py --query "text classification" --limit 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple queries):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel (venv activate does NOT work in parallel subshells):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_search_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S --query {} --limit 3' ::: 'sentiment' 'classification' 'translation'
```

**Example output:**
```
Found 5 dataset(s) for query='text classification'

============================================================
Dataset 1: stanfordnlp/imdb
Downloads: 2,500,000 | Likes: 1,234
Description: Large Movie Review Dataset for binary sentiment classification...
Tags: text-classification, en, sentiment-analysis
```

**Result fields per dataset:**

Each entry in ``results`` carries:

- ``id`` / ``downloads`` / ``likes`` / ``tags`` / ``description`` — standard
  HF metadata
- ``has_loader_script`` (bool) — repo ships a top-level ``<repo>.py`` loader.
  ``datasets>=3`` won't run these directly; the dataset is reachable only
  via the Datasets Server's pre-converted parquet shards. Treat as a yellow
  flag.
- ``loadable`` (bool) — **prefer datasets where this is ``True``.** Means
  the dataset is reachable via *some* path: either native parquet (no
  script) or HF auto-converted the script's output to parquet. When
  ``False``, the script needs deps HF can't install (e.g. ``conllu``,
  custom audio decoders) and ``aii_hf_datasets__download_datasets`` will
  fail — pick a different candidate.

**Parameters:**

`--query` (optional)
- Search query string
- Example: `--query "sentiment analysis"`

`--limit` (optional)
- Maximum number of results (default: 5)

`--tags` (optional)
- Filter by tags (comma-separated)
- Format: `category:value`
- Examples: `language:en`, `task_categories:text-classification`

`--sort` (optional)
- Sort by field: `downloads`, `likes` (default: downloads)

**Tips:**
- Search displays full dataset metadata
- Use tags to filter: `--tags "language:en,task_categories:translation"`

---

### Preview HuggingFace Dataset (aii_hf_preview_datasets.py)

Inspect a specific dataset - shows metadata AND sample rows.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --num-rows 5
```

**Parallel execution (multiple datasets):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel:
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_preview_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite '$PY $S {} --num-rows 3' ::: 'openai/gsm8k' 'imdb' 'squad'
```

**Example output:**
```

`--config` (optional)
- Dataset configuration/subset name
- Auto-detects first config if not specified

`--split` (optional)
- Split to preview (default: `train`)

`--num-rows` (optional)
- Number of sample rows (default: 5, max: 20)

`--revision` (optional)
- Git revision of the dataset repo; a commit SHA pins the exact bytes
- Default: the Hub's current `main`

**Tips:**

---

### Download HuggingFace Dataset (aii_hf_download_datasets.py)

Download datasets and save to files.

**Example input:**
```bash
SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python $SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py openai/gsm8k --config main --split train
```

**Parallel execution (multiple datasets):**

IMPORTANT: Use full python path with GNU parallel. Use `eval {}` pattern when datasets need different flags (e.g. `--config`):
```bash
export SKILL_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /ai-inventor)/.claude/skills/aii-hf-datasets" && \
export PY="$SKILL_DIR/../.ability_client_venv/bin/python" && \
export S="$SKILL_DIR/scripts/aii_hf_download_datasets.py" && \
parallel -j 10 -k --group --will-cite 'eval {}' ::: '$PY $S openai/gsm8k --config main --split train' '$PY $S imdb --split train' '$PY $S squad --split train'
```

**Example output:**
```
Downloaded: openai/gsm8k

  train:
    Rows: 7,473
    Preview: temp/datasets/preview_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
    Mini: temp/datasets/mini_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
    Full: temp/datasets/full_openai_gsm8k_main_train.json
```

**Parameters:**

`dataset_id` (required, positional)
- HuggingFace dataset ID
- Examples: `openai/gsm8k`, `imdb`

`--config` (optional)
- Dataset configuration/subset name
- Use preview to see available configs

`--split` (optional)
- Specific split to load (e.g., `train`, `test`)
- If not specified, loads all splits

`--output-dir` (optional)
- Output directory (default: `temp/datasets/`)

`--revision` (optional)
- Git revision of the dataset repo; a commit SHA pins the exact bytes
- Default: the Hub's current `main`

**Output files (auto-saved):**
1. **Preview**: `preview_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 truncated rows - **READ THIS** for quick inspection
2. **Mini**: `mini_{dataset}_{split}.json` - 3 full rows - for development/testing
3. **Full**: `full_{dataset}_{split}.json` - All rows - **DO NOT READ directly** - use as input path for code

**Tips:**
- Only read preview file directly with Read tool
- Mini and full are input paths for processing code

**If the script fails** with a connection error (ability server not running): create a local `.venv`, install server deps from `server_requirements.txt` into it, then import the `@aii_ability` function from the script and call it directly — bypassing the server:
```bash
uv venv .venv --python=3.12 && uv pip install --python=.venv/bin/python -r "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/server_requirements.txt"
```
